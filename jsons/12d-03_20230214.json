Originally produced by Wesley Akin Hotchkiss. The number of persons per church field was created by repeating the legend item into the attribute table, and the number of churches field was created by counting the number of dots that fall into each polygon. The map was created as a combination of Chicago community areas and Illinois municipalities map, that fit the locations and names in both shapefiles and map legends. The birds eye view map was distorted to fit the NAD 83 Illinois East projection system, and therefore, the further away from the center of the map, the more distorted the georeferencing is. The georeferencing method is the third order polynomial, which was enough to identify the polygons, but not to estimate with certainty the location of the dots places on the original map. Due to that difference, the dot representing the churches were counted, not placed on the vector map. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Call number: G4104.C6E42 1940.H61.
