This online dashboard displays information related to how safe Chicago residents feel and how much trust they have in the police.\n\nThe dashboard and this dataset are updated monthly and users are able to view data citywide, as well as within the five detective areas and in each of the 22 districts. Users can sort this data based on year, month and location. Information is also available based on demographics, including age, sex, race, education and income level. The dashboard is meant to improve transparency as well as work toward compliance with the consent decree.\n\nThe first five columns indicate the type of organizational unit described by the records and which particular unit. Subsequent columns show either a safety or trust score for a demographic group. Scores are derived from responses to survey questions, with each response being a value that ranges from 0-10. Please note that Elucd trust and safety scores are NOT a percentage. A score of 65 means that average response to the questions is 6.5 out of 10. The final two columns show the time period in which the data were collected.\n\nThe dataset was created by our partner, Elucd (https://elucd.com), through delivering short surveys to Chicago residents through digital ads. See [https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard_FAQ_11_25_20.pdf] for more information on the project.\n\nThis effort is one element of a Chicago Police Department reform process, governed by a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago.

The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. \n \nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation).\n \nHistorically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. \nThe culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\n \nThe statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.\n \n* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water.

This includes people who received a monovalent booster dose and immunocompromised people who received an additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine.  Monovalent doses were created from the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\u00b7People with a bivalent dose: Number of people who received a bivalent (updated) dose of vaccine. Updated, bivalent doses became available in Fall 2022 and were created with the original strain of COVID-19 and newer Omicron variant strains. \n\n\u00b7Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.\n\nDaily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have a completed vaccine series, number of people with a monovalent booster dose, and number of people with a bivalent dose. Cumulative totals are also provided for each measure as of that date.

Doses administered by the federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Defense, are also not currently reported in I-CARE. The Veterans Health Administration began reporting doses in I-CARE beginning September 2022. Due to people receiving vaccinations that are not recorded in I-CARE that can be linked to their record, such as someone receiving a vaccine dose in another state, the number of people with a completed series or a booster dose is underestimated. Inconsistencies in records of separate doses administered to the same person, such as slight variations in dates of birth, can result in duplicate first dose records for a person and overestimate of the number of people with at least one dose and underestimate the number of people with a completed series or booster dose.   \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

Care should be taken when summing values to avoid accidental double-counting.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the home ZIP Code of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE).

Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received.\n\u00b7Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.\n\nDaily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, and number of people who have a completed vaccine series. Cumulative totals for each measure as of that date are also provided. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.\n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on cumulative number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose and cumulative number of people who have a completed vaccine series in each ZIP Code.\n\nPopulation counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-year estimates and can be seen in the ZIP Code, 2019 rows of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\n\nActual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in areas with small population sizes.

It was intended only as a simple tool to collect such information as people cared to submit and should be interpreted in that spirit.\n\nA copy of the original survey is at <a href=\"https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&token=bfa6889e0f674cd6a4f1fedccb402c8d&wdlor=cF4F6C0D3-9163-45CB-A834-4D4CA5D9F255&id=qc02cC0GUUGBRJfdxW5wJ2WUSmVcTNRNtAgDSPV9FxxUMUMyUDQ5RUw1WTRSTDdNRlY2U1lCVUhDVy4u&analysis=false\">this link</a>.", "title": "12th Ward Aldermanic Selection Survey - 2022", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5n77-2d6a/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Administration & Finance"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5neh-572f", "issued": "2018-05-18", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2022-12-19", "keyword": ["chicago transit authority", "cta", "public transit", "ridership"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "CTA", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5neh-572f", "description": "This list shows daily totals of ridership, by station entry, for each 'L' station dating back to 2001.

This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. \u201cVehicle\u201d information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

Cases are counted by week the test specimen was collected.\r\n\u2022\tHospitalizations: COVID-19 cases who are hospitalized due to a documented COVID-19 related illness or who are admitted for any reason within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Hospitalizations are counted by week of hospital admission.\r\n\u2022\tDeaths: COVID-19 cases who died from COVID-19-related health complications as determined by vital records or a public health investigation. Deaths are counted by week of death.\r\n\r\nVaccination status:\r\n\u2022\tFully vaccinated: Completion of primary series of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\r\n\u2022\tBoosted: Fully vaccinated with an additional or booster dose of any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine received at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\r\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated: No evidence of having received a dose of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test. \r\n\r\nCLARIFYING NOTE: Those who started but did not complete all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test (i.e., partially vaccinated) are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nIncidence rates for fully vaccinated but not boosted people (Vaccinated columns) are calculated as total fully vaccinated but not boosted with outcome divided by cumulative fully vaccinated but not boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for boosted (Boosted columns) are calculated as total boosted with outcome divided by cumulative boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for unvaccinated (Unvaccinated columns) are calculated as total unvaccinated with outcome divided by total population minus cumulative boosted, fully, and partially vaccinated at the end of each week. All rates are multiplied by 100,000. \r\n\r\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs) are calculated by dividing the weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by those among fully vaccinated but not boosted and boosted people. \r\n\r\nOverall age-adjusted incidence rates and IRRs are standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population.\r\n\r\nPopulation totals are from U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2019. \r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. This dataset reflects data known to CDPH at the time when the dataset is updated each week.\r\n\r\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.\r\n\r\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy", "title": "COVID-19 Outcomes by Vaccination Status", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6irb-gasv/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Health & Human Services"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/6mci-28cz", "issued": "2018-01-18", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2023-02-02", "keyword": ["2018", "2019", "boundaries", "cps", "district", "elections", "local school council", "map_layer", "schools", "voting"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Adam Jentleson", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6mci-28cz", "description": "Local School Council voting districts for citywide and neighborhood public schools, intended to verify eligibility to run in LSC elections for 2018-2020.

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that  Division Code, Section Code, Subsection Code, and Position Control have changed from Number to Text (not all in the same year) in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\n\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.", "title": "Budget - 2021 Budget Recommendations - Positions and Salaries", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7b5w-rzes/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Administration & Finance"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/7bzs-jsyj", "issued": "2016-12-07", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2023-03-16", "keyword": ["house share", "regulation", "restrictions"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jonathan Levy", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/7bzs-jsyj", "description": "A list of buildings excluded from short-term rental activity under the Shared Housing Ordinance.

Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation.

A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago\u2019s police reform webpage: \n\nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html\n\nThis dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80. \n\nParagraph 79 of the consent decree states that:\nBy April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (\u201cANOVs\u201d) effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender.  \n\nThen, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: \nUpon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform. \n\nThis dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV\u2019s are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system.\n\nTo request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section at https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia.. \n\nNOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset. Each record in the dataset is a unique, unduplicated citation. \n\nUsers interested in learning more about how CPD handles ANOV citations can review the current policy, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\r\n\r\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that  Division Code, Section Code, Subsection Code, and Position Control have changed from Number to Text (not all in the same year) in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/budget.html.", "title": "Budget - 2023 Budget Recommendations - Positions and Salaries", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d6ui-3yap/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Administration & Finance"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/d7as-muwj", "issued": "2022-08-31", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2022-11-29", "keyword": ["2022", "2023", "cps", "metrics", "report cards", "schools"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Ted Canji", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj", "description": "2022-2023 school progress report ratings for all Chicago Public Schools.", "title": "Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY2223", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d7as-muwj/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Education"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/d8hd-y5ce", "issued": "2022-12-02", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2022-12-15", "keyword": ["2022", "2023", "attendance", "boundaries", "cps", "geo_layer", "gis", "schools"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Saira Riaz", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/d8hd-y5ce", "description": "Attendance boundaries for elementary schools in the Chicago Public Schools district for school year 2022-2023.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

The major difference in this dataset is that the case, death, and hospitalization corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data.\r\n\r\nAll rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for \u201cTotal\u201d columns.\r\n\r\nOnly Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.\r\n\r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths among cases are aggregated by day of death. Hospitalizations are reported by date of first hospital admission. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers or collected by CDPH during follow-up investigation.\r\n\r\nDenominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH.\r\n\r\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.\r\n\r\nData Source: Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey", "title": "COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average Case, Death, and Hospitalization Rates", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e68t-c7fv/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Health & Human Services"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/e6xh-nr8w", "issued": "2013-02-08", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2016-08-24", "keyword": ["boundaries", "business", "gis", "kml", "kmz", "shapefiles"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jonathan Levy", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/e6xh-nr8w", "description": "Current industrial corridors in Chicago.

Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each region are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\n\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \n\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\n1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder", "title": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gumc-mgzr/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Public Safety"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gyxj-75ni", "issued": "2016-08-23", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2018-08-08", "keyword": ["2013", "2014", "attendance", "boundaries", "cps", "gis", "kml", "kmz", "map_layer", "schools", "shapefiles"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Adam Jentleson", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/gyxj-75ni", "description": "Attendance boundaries for middle schools in the Chicago Public Schools district for school year 2013-2014.

Vision Zero is Chicago\u2019s commitment to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The VZC Traffic Fatality List is compiled by the City\u2019s multi-departmental Fatal Crash Response Coordination Committee (FCRCC) that reviews fatal traffic crashes provided by Chicago Police Department\u2019s Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU). The dataset is updated after the FCRCC meetings in the 4th week of the month. Thus, the fatality list for a particular month will be available in the dataset after the 4th week of the following month. \n\nThis committee uses a standardized process \u2013 sometimes differing from other sources and everyday use of the term -- to determine whether a death is a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for VZC purposes. Therefore, the traffic fatalities included in this list may differ from the fatal crashes reported in the full Traffic Crashes dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if).\n\nOfficial traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on a yearly basis. The traffic fatality list determined on an ongoing basis through the year may differ from IDOT\u2019s official crash data for Chicago as IDOT may define the cause and location differently from the FCRCC. Once IDOT publishes its data for a year, crashes in this dataset for that year are edited to match IDOT\u2019s determinations, unless the FCRCC disagrees with the IDOT determination \u2013 which happens only rarely and usually due to an interpretation of one of the criteria below.\n\nVZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the \u201cRD_NO\u201d or \u201cPerson_ID\u201d fields.\n\nThe FCRCC defines a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for the purpose of VZC statistics as \"any death caused by a traffic crash, within 30 days of the crash\u201d and \u201cinvolves a motor vehicle.\u201d Fatalities that meet the VZC definition of a traffic fatality are included in this dataset unless excluded by the criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets.\n\nThe following criteria exclude a death from being considered a \"traffic fatality\" for VZC purposes:\n\n1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including:\n\na. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation.\n\nb. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the \"party at fault\" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death.\n\nc. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or where the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hit and kills another road user, the other road user is included although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.)\n\n2. The crash did not occur within the public right-of-way.\n\n3. The crash involved a train or such mode of transport within their dedicated right-of-way.\n\n4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including:\n\na. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities.\n\nb. The fatality occurred outside City limits. Crashes on streets along the City boundary may be assigned to another jurisdiction after the investigation if it is determined that the crash started or substantially occurred on the side of the street that is outside the City limits. Jurisdiction of streets along the City boundary are split between City and neighboring jurisdictions along the street center line.\n\n5.

This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs.\r\n\r\nThere are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

Measurements are made from the property line and exclude streets, alleys, and public ways. This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs. There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \u2022\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. \u2022\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use this KML file, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "title": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Transportation"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4yu-snrx", "issued": "2016-01-14", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2016-08-24", "keyword": ["boundaries", "deprecated", "gis", "kml", "map_layer", "shapefiles", "tif"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Jonathan Levy", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4yu-snrx", "description": "OUTDATED.

The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite\u2019s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet.

ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits\u201d to \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits\u201d at the same time.\n\nData Source: Illinois Hospital Emergency Departments reporting to CDPH through the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP)", "title": "COVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qwib-edaw/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Health & Human Services"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qxjd-z277", "issued": "2011-04-17", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2011-08-28", "keyword": ["facilities", "gis", "shapefiles"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "cocadmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/qxjd-z277", "description": "Schools grounds in Chicago.

There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "title": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"mediaType": "application/rdf+xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/columns.rdf", "describedByType": "application/rdf+xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/json", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/columns.json", "describedByType": "application/json", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}, {"mediaType": "application/xml", "downloadURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "describedBy": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/columns.xml", "describedByType": "application/xml", "@type": "dcat:Distribution"}], "theme": ["Transportation"]}, {"accessLevel": "public", "landingPage": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2rn-p8d7", "issued": "2018-05-18", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "modified": "2022-12-19", "keyword": ["cta", "public transit", "ridership"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "CTA", "hasEmail": "mailto:no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org"}, "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "identifier": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2rn-p8d7", "description": "This dataset lists monthly station entry averages, by day type (Weekday, Saturday or Sunday/Holiday), as well as monthly totals, beginning in 2001.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.
