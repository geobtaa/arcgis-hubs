Funding for remediation and abatement is limited. To adequately target households eligible for home remediation and associated intervention efforts, local healthy homes and environmental health program administrators must identify neighborhoods that are the most \u201cat risk\u201d of residential lead exposure where deteriorated paint is the primary source. To address this need, the DPI uses household-level data to predict a household\u2019s risk of deteriorated paint.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Predicted risk scores were calculated using microdata from the 2011 American Housing Survey (AHS) and the 2009-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) to develop a predicted risk measure. This metric estimates the predicted percentage of occupied housing units with large areas of deteriorated paint for three geographic levels: state, county, and tract. The primary methodological goal of the analysis was to post-fit ACS households with beta parameters from an AHS model that predicted the presence of a large area of deteriorated paint.

Equally abundant are debates about what is urban or rural and which factors should be used to define these terms. Absent from most of this discussion is evidence about how people perceive or describe their neighborhood. Moreover, as several housing and demographic researchers have noted, the lack of an official or unofficial definition of suburban obscures the stylized fact that a majority of Americans live in a suburban setting. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development added a simple question to the 2017 American Housing Survey (AHS) asking respondents to describe their neighborhood as urban, suburban, or rural. This service provides a tract-level dataset illustrating the outcome of analysis techniques applied to neighborhood classification reported by the American Housing Survey (AHS) as either urban, suburban, or rural.\n\t</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font size='3'>To create this data, analysts\u00a0first applied machine learning techniques to the AHS neighborhood description question to build a model that predicts how out-of-sample households would describe their neighborhood (urban, suburban, or rural), given regional and neighborhood characteristics. Analysts then applied the model to the American Community Survey (ACS) aggregate tract-level regional and neighborhood measures, thereby creating a predicted likelihood the average household in a census tract would describe their neighborhood as urban, suburban, and rural. This last step is commonly referred to as small area estimation. The approach is an example of the use of existing federal data to create innovative new data products of substantial interest to researchers and policy makers alike.</font></p>\n\n\n<p><font size='3'>If aggregating tract-level probabilities to larger areas, users are strongly\nencouraged to use occupied household counts as weights.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size='3'>We recommend users read Section 7 of the working paper before using the raw probabilities.

Results of those calculations are  classified according to a quartile distribution of all values  relative to attribute, and each cell receives a score according to its quartile class: 0  points for a cell value less than the 25th percentile, 1 point if between the  25th and 50th percentile, 2 points if between the 50th and 75th percentile, 3  points if greater than the 75th percentile. The index value represents the aggregation of quartile points awarded for each attribute of  a particular cell.</p><p style='text-align:justify;'><b><br /></b></p><p style='text-align:justify;'><b>SUGGESTED USE OF DATA</b></p>\n<p>Fields ending with the suffix, \u201c_INDX\u201d  provide spatially relevant severity indices for min/max cold snaps and heat  waves. As described previously, the value for each index represents the  summation of attributes scores determined by a quartile distribution of all  values for each facet of analysis. Index scores for these fields range from 0  to 9 providing for a relatively smooth surface map illustrating spatial variability.</p><p>\n  In contrast, fields ending with  the suffix, \u201c_IND\u201d are binary attributes that indicate areas where the index  values for both night-time (tmin) and day-time (tmax) is &gt;= 5 relative to  each event type. Given the boolean nature of data in these fields they are best used to quickly identify areas of extreme temperature to answer policy related questions, and not necessarily for illustration or spatial analysis.</p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:medium;'><br /></span></p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:medium;'>Data Dictionary:\u00a0</span><a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/848f6a00f3f94001bd7ab7b604457346/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>DD_Temperature Severity Index</a></p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:medium;'>Date of Coverage: 1913 - 2013</span><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:medium;'>\u00a0</span></p></div>", "keyword": ["U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development", "HUD", "Policy Development and Research", "PDR", "Program Monitoring and Research Division", "eGIS", "PMRD", "Temperature", "Heat Wave", "Cold Snap", "Housing", "Utility", "Health", "Planning", "hud.official.content"], "issued": "2019-02-15T21:52:29.000Z", "modified": "2019-03-05T21:33:30.506Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-126.0000,23.0001,-65.0000,52.0001", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::temperature-severity-indicators"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/Temperature_Severity_Indicators/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::temperature-severity-indicators.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4326%2C%22wkid%22%3A4326%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::temperature-severity-indicators.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4326%2C%22wkid%22%3A4326%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::temperature-severity-indicators.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4326%2C%22wkid%22%3A4326%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::temperature-severity-indicators.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4326%2C%22wkid%22%3A4326%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b0496a9daa8a4faab1efd2762ac6b9c1&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::sustainable-communities-regional-planning-grantees", "title": "Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grantees", "description": "<p>This map layer displays the planning areas of the winners of the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant competition for FY2010 and FY2011.

This flexibility makes it one of the most potent and important public investment tools that HUD offers to local governments.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><font size='3'>To learn more about the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program visit:\u00a0<a href='https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/</b></a>\n  \n  <br />\n  Data Dictionary:\u00a0<a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/86fc8c4018794ce894b4b63025e04703/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>DD_Section 108 Grantee Areas</b></a><br /></font></p>", "keyword": ["U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development", "HUD", "Community Planning and Development", "CPD", "Community Development Block Grant", "CDBG", "Community Development Programs", "hud.official.content"], "issued": "2018-02-13T15:58:25.000Z", "modified": "2022-02-10T14:58:35.773Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-150.2817,17.8813,-65.5274,61.4839", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::section-108-grantee-areas"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/Section_108_Grantee_Areas/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::section-108-grantee-areas.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::section-108-grantee-areas.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::section-108-grantee-areas.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::section-108-grantee-areas.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5089f5682e8d4ad483bec3966ddbc45f&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::rural-innovation-fund-grantee-areas", "title": "Rural Innovation Fund Grantee Areas", "description": "<p>Data for this service is derived from one of two sources: Rural Innovation Fund grantee applications describing proposed allocation areas using U.S. Census block geography, or block-level data identified and selected through the use of mapping tool available to applicants through HUDUSER.gov.</p>\n<p>Each Grantee was allowed up to three target area locations according to the RIF NOFA.

The definition involves a\nracial/ethnic concentration threshold and a poverty test. The racial/ethnic\nconcentration threshold is straightforward: R/ECAPs must have a non-white\npopulation of 50 percent or more. Regarding the poverty threshold, Wilson\n(1980) defines neighborhoods of extreme poverty as census tracts with 40\npercent or more of individuals living at or below the poverty line. Because\noverall poverty levels are substantially lower in many parts of the country,\nHUD supplements this with an alternate criterion. Thus, a neighborhood can be a\nR/ECAP if it has a poverty rate that exceeds 40% or is three or more times the\naverage tract poverty rate for the metropolitan/micropolitan area, whichever\nthreshold is lower. Census tracts with this extreme poverty that satisfy the\nracial/ethnic concentration threshold are deemed R/ECAPs. This translates into\nthe following equation:\u00a0</p><p style='margin-bottom:0.0001pt;'><br /></p><p style='text-align:center; margin-bottom:0.0001pt;'><img alt='recap_formula' src='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/3fa5dbb7edf84ab9b253e55b234a84cf/data' /><br /></p><p style='margin-bottom:0.0001pt;'><br /></p><p style='margin-bottom:0.0001pt;'>Where\u00a0<i>i</i>\u00a0represents\ncensus tracts\u00a0is the metropolitan/micropolitan (CBSA) mean tract poverty\nrate, <i>PovRate</i> is the\u00a0<i>i</i>th tract poverty rate\u00a0is the\nnon-Hispanic white population in tract\u00a0<i>i</i>, and <i>Pop </i>is the population\nin tract\u00a0<i>i</i>.</p><p style='margin-bottom:0.0001pt;'>While this definition of\nR/ECAP works well for tracts in CBSAs, place outside of these geographies are\nunlikely to have racial or ethnic concentrations as high as 50 percent.

This service aggregates NSP activity at the 2010 tract-level geography of the U.S. Census.</p>\n<p>Please note that the data offered in this  service is derived from an extract of HUD\u2019s Office of Community Planning and  Development (CPD) Disaster Recovery Grants Reporting (DRGR) System. Each  observation in the raw DRGR extract is an address at which an NSP activity took  place. If multiple activities took place at one address, that address would be  in the database multiple times and would over-count NSP activity. This is  likely to be the case if a grantee reports the same property under an  acquisition activity and a rehab activity.</p>\n<p>Steps have been taken to mitigate the  occurrences of over-counting through the standardization of addresses, the  prioritization of activity types for those addresses where more than one  activity took place, and then the removal of duplicate addresses. For example, if  a grantee reported an acquisition and rehab activity at the same address, the  rehab activity will be prioritized over the acquisition, and the acquisition  will be removed.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the data will also over-count NSP  activity if grantees enter an activity at a single address in multiple  quarterly performance reports; much of this double counting will also be  mitigated through the standardization and duplicate removal process.  Conversely, if multiple units were assisted at a single address, that address  would under-represent NSP activity. This is likely to be the case if a grantee  reports a single address that represents a group of properties or a property  with multiple units.</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><font size='3'>To learn more about the  Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) visit:\u00a0<a href='https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/nsp/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/nsp/</b></a>\n  \n  <br />\n  Data Dictionary:\u00a0<a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/3d8686ba165b4b3d93171f40fcdbd407/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>DD_NSP Activity by Tract</b></a><br />\nData Updated: <b>03/2020</b></font></p>", "keyword": ["U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development", "   HUD", "   Community Planning and Development", "   CPD", "   Neighborhood Stabilization Plan", "   NSP", "   Community Development Programs", "   HUD.Official.Content"], "issued": "2018-02-20T16:52:09.000Z", "modified": "2020-08-04T18:56:48.938Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-159.5085,18.0251,-66.8405,64.8484", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::nsp-activity-by-tract"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/NSP_Activity_by_Tract/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::nsp-activity-by-tract.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::nsp-activity-by-tract.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::nsp-activity-by-tract.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::nsp-activity-by-tract.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c881dc45c7842a8b100b0734f0a145e&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies", "title": "MTW Participating Agencies", "description": "<p><font size='3'>Moving to Work (MTW) is a demonstration program for public housing authorities (PHAs) that provides  the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for low-income families.

Currently, there are 39 MTW PHAs nationwide and HUD plans to expand the program to addition 100 PHAs by 2022.</font></p>\n\n<p>This feature service provides location data for PHA administrative offices of housing authorities participating in the Morving to Work demonstration program, and that data is derivied from from HUD's enterprise geocoding service.</p>\n\n<p><font size='3'>Please note that, for the purposes of the Moving to Work demonstration program, AK001 and AK901 are counted as single organization as are CA056 and CA059.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size='3'>To learn more about the CDBG Program visit: <a href='https://www.hud.gov/mtw' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>https://www.hud.gov/mtw</b></a>\n  \n<br />\nData Dictionary:\u00a0<b><a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/bb51b6daf0ad4e70b80cb1fe3fe0e41e/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>DD_MTW Participating Agencies</a>.</b><br />\nDate of Coverage: <b>2019</b><br /></font></p>", "keyword": ["US Department of Housing and Urban Development", " HUD", " Public and Indian Housing", " PIH", " Public Housing Authorities", " PHA", " Moving To Work", " MTW", " Community Development Programs", " hud.offical.content"], "issued": "2019-12-03T14:36:40.000Z", "modified": "2019-12-03T15:01:37.011Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-149.7788,28.5466,-71.0614,61.1821", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/MTW_Participating_Agencies/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::mtw-participating-agencies.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=58ebe2dc6645452d9702c0adb8033460&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::low-transportation-cost-index", "title": "Low Transportation Cost Index", "description": "<p style='margin-top:6.0pt; background:white;'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:#4D4D4D;'>Summary</span></i><span style='font-size:13.0pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:#4D4D4D;'></span></p>\n\n<p style='margin-top:6.0pt; background:white;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color:#4D4D4D;'>The\nLow Transportation Cost Index is based on estimates of transportation expenses\nfor a family that meets the following description: a 3-person single-parent\nfamily with income at 50% of the median income for renters for the region (i.e.\nCBSA).

Non-entitlement communities receive CDBG funding from their respective states in accordance with requirements that state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><font size='3'>To learn more about the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership visit:\u00a0<a href='https://lehd.ces.census.gov/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>https://lehd.ces.census.gov/</b></a>\n  \n  <br />\n  Data Dictionary:\u00a0<a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/ba776afac4db426c8c6e3f732c8d6152/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>DD_LED for CDBG Grantee Areas</b></a>\n  <br />\n  Date of Coverage: <b>CDBG-2021/LED-2018</b><br /></font></p>", "keyword": ["U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development", "HUD", "Community Planning and Development", "CPD", "Community Development Block Grant", "CDBG", "Grantee Areas", "Local Employment Dynamics", "LED", "Quarterly Workforce Indicators", "QWI", "Community Development Program"], "issued": "2018-02-12T21:36:22.000Z", "modified": "2022-01-13T18:33:33.415Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-179.1473,17.8813,179.7785,71.3905", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::led-for-cdbg-grantee-areas"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/LED_for_CDBG_Grantee_Areas/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::led-for-cdbg-grantee-areas.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::led-for-cdbg-grantee-areas.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::led-for-cdbg-grantee-areas.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::led-for-cdbg-grantee-areas.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a739f7424ffc4825b3c72cb5b04fbccc&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::labor-market-engagement-index", "title": "Labor Market Engagement Index", "description": "<p style='margin:12pt 0in 0pt; padding:0px; text-align:center;'><font size='5'>LABOR MARKET ENGAGEMENT INDEX</font></p><p style='margin:6pt 0in 0pt; padding:0px; color:rgb(77, 77, 77);'><i><b><font size='3'>Summary</font></b></i></p>\n\n\n<p style='margin:6pt 0in 0pt; padding:0px; color:rgb(77, 77, 77);'><font size='3'>The labor market engagement index provides a summary description of the relative intensity of labor market engagement and human capital in a neighborhood.

Payments are made once a year after the end of the period of performance for that agency.</p>\n<p><font size='3'>To learn more about the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) visit:\u00a0<a href='https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/partners/FHAP' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/partners/FHAP</b></a>\n  \n  <br />\n  Data Dictionary:\u00a0</font><a href='https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/071f74e4594244c586dd6486c0209e2e/data' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'><b>DD_Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP)</b></a><font size='3'><b>\u00a0</b><br />\nDate of Coverage: <b>2020</b>\u00a0<br /></font></p>", "keyword": ["U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development", "HUD", "Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity", "FHEO", "Fair Housing Assistance Program", "FHAP", "Fair Housing", "hud.official.content"], "issued": "2018-02-13T15:12:26.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-01T20:49:43.942Z", "publisher": {"name": "Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "HUD.Official.Content", "hasEmail": "mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-157.8609,21.3038,-69.7802,47.2557", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::fair-housing-assistance-program-grantees"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/VTyQ9soqVukalItT/arcgis/rest/services/Fair_Housing_Assistance_Program_Grantees/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::fair-housing-assistance-program-grantees.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::fair-housing-assistance-program-grantees.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::fair-housing-assistance-program-grantees.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::fair-housing-assistance-program-grantees.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c7e2c62560bd4a999f0e0b2f4cee2494&sublayer=0", "landingPage": "https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/HUD::environmental-health-hazard-index", "title": "Environmental Health Hazard Index", "description": "<p style='margin:12pt 0in 0pt;

These datasets, known as &quot;CHAS&quot; (Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy) data, demonstrate the extent of housing problems and housing needs, particularly for low income households.The primary purpose of CHAS data is to demonstrate the number of households in need of housing assistance. This is estimated by the number of households that have certain housing problems and have income low enough to qualify for HUD\u2019s programs (primarily 30, 50, and 80 percent of median income). CHAS data provides counts of the numbers of households that fit these HUD-specified characteristics in a variety of geographic areas.
