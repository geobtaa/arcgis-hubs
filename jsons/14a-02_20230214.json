Through an on-screen visual interpretation of digital orthophotography, CRSSA identified over 13,000 potential pools throughout the state. A subset of these pools was field verified and confirmed, with an 88% accuracy rate, to meet the physical characteristics to qualify as a vernal pool (Lathrop et al. 2005). In accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4, the term \"vernal habitat\" includes a vernal pool - or the area of ponding - plus any freshwater wetlands adjacent to the vernal pool. Vernal habitat areas mapped in the Landscape Project rely upon those data developed by the DEP and CRSSA to identify sites that should be field checked for possible identification as vernal habitats areas. DEP staff is in the process of field-verifying these pools. The Department also maps vernal habitat areas based upon on-the-ground assessment of sites not captured by the CRSSA mapping. The Landscape Project includes all of the CRSAA-identified sites, as well as sites identified by on-the-ground reconnaissance, categorized as either \"potential vernal habitat areas\" or \"vernal habitat areas\" as defined below: Potential vernal habitat area - These are areas identified by CRSSA as possibly containing a vernal pool that meets the criteria of a \"vernal habitat\" pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. These sites include sites that have been field inspected and have been found to meet the physical characteristics of a vernal habitat, but for which biological criteria have not yet been measured, as well as sites that have not been checked by DEP staff. Vernal habitat areas - These are areas that contain pools that have been field-verified by the Department and have been determined to meet both the physical and biological characteristics of a vernal habitat in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. All areas mapped as \"potential vernal habitat areas\" and \"vernal habitat areas\" are derived from a point location estimated to be the center of an individual vernal pool and include all areas within 300 meters of the point. Note that the occurrence area is not intended to suggest or correspond with any specific regulatory requirement.

A subset of these pools was field verified and confirmed, with an 88% accuracy rate (Lathrop et al. 2005), to meet the physical characteristics to qualify as a vernal pool.In accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4, the term \"vernal habitat\" includes a vernal pool - or the area of ponding - plus any freshwater wetlands adjacent to the vernal pool. The Department here includes mapping of vernal habitat locations that relies upon data developed by the Department and Rutgers University Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) to identify sites that should be field checked for possible identification as vernal habitats areas. DEP staff is in the process of field-verifying these pools. The Department also maps vernal habitat areas based upon on-the-ground assessment of sites not captured by the CRSSA mapping.

The 0.75 kilometer distance is chosen as a conservative buffer estimate because scientific literature, which is based largely upon larval transport by host fishes, indicates that if there are two occurrences within two kilometers of each other (assuming unsuitable habitat between), these occurrences should be considered as part of the same local population (NatureServe 2011). In the cases where stream buffers of separate occurrences of the same species met, either upstream or downstream, the stream segments between those occurrences are also valued for that species.

You can also find a breakdown of housing age by county and municipality. Housing are categorized into four categories \u2013 pre-1950, 1951-1978, post-1978, and unavailable. Prior to the 1950s, lead-based paint was commonly used for both home interiors and exteriors. Exposure in older homes happens when lead-based paint starts to deteriorate, cracking or peeling away from the walls. That decay results in lead-contaminated dust, which may be directly ingested or inhaled, and paint chips, which may be touched or, less commonly, ingested. Living in a house with lead-based paint can result in a chronic accumulation of the heavy metal in the body. Houses built after 1978 are less likely to contain lead-based paints. That year, Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in homes built or rehabilitated with federal funding through the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. By 1992, the act was amended to address lead-contaminated dust and soil in homes, as well as adopt preventive strategies to reduce future lead exposure. These homes face the lowest risk of potential lead exposure. In the 1950s, the paint industry voluntary adopted its own standards to phase out and prohibit the use of lead additives, such that homes built between 1950 and 1978 have only some risk of potential lead exposure.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["Health", "boundary", "county", "Municipality", "township", "city", "New Jersey", "health", "borough", "Parcels", "boundaries", "town", "MOD-IV", "municipal", "Municipalities Lead Exposure Information", "NJDEP", "Envr_mon_lead_exposure", "NJ", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2021-10-25T20:08:01.000Z", "modified": "2021-10-25T20:08:26.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Office of Environmental Public Health and Safety"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5871,38.9246,-73.8992,41.3578", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Important to surface water systems; 5. critical to protect water supplies; and 6. Valuable for and provide flood \"storage capacity. All priority areas are listed by specific geographic area.

What is meant by impervious surface is material such as concrete and asphalt that comprise roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and buildings. As the land use/land cover of each polygon was mapped from 2007 aerial photography, a visual estimate was also made of the amount of impervious surface in each. This estimate was recorded as a percentage of the total polygon area, in 5% increments, which are depicted here. These percentages can be used to determine the total acreage of impervious surface in any area of interest. The 2007 LU/LC data set is the fourth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002 and 2007. This present 2007 update was created by comparing the 2002 LU/LC layer from NJ DEP's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database to 2007 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2007 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2002 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2002-2007 can be undertaken from this one layer.

What is meant by impervious surface is material such as concrete and asphalt that comprise roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and buildings. As the land use/land cover of each polygon was mapped from 2012 aerial photography, a visual estimate was also made of the amount of impervious surface in each. This estimate was recorded as a percentage of the total polygon area, in 5% increments, which are depicted here. These percentages can be used to determine the total acreage of impervious surface in any area of interest. The 2012 LU/LC data set is the fifth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002, 2007 and 2012. This present 2012 update was created by comparing the 2007 LU/LC layer from NJDEP's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database to 2012 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2012 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2007 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2007-2012 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre.

The Arc/INFO LULC coverage has been converted to an ArcView shapefile for distribution. The ITUM land use/land cover was photo interpreted from 1986 color infrared (CIR) 1:58000 aerial photos, and delineated using a modified Anderson et al. 1976, classification system to 1:24000 rectified photo-basemaps. These basemaps complied with National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) as individual quadrangles but were not produced from a sophisticated aero-triangulation photogrammetric solution. Minimum mapping unit = 2.5 acres. The ITUM land use/land cover was integrated with three other sources (soils, USGS floodprone areas, and 1906 Atlas Sheet Geology) based on coincident features. The four data layers have subsequently been split out into four separate themes for distribution and use. Beginning in 1998, the NJDEP does not support the data as a single integrated ITUM theme but rather as four separate themes. Freshwater wetlands delineations were made on 1986 orthophoto quarterquad basemaps (1:12000) by photo interpretation of 1986 CIR photos. The classification system used was a modified Cowardin system (Cowardin, et al., 1979). All freshwater wetland polygons greater than 1 acre in area and all linear freshwater wetland features greater than 10 feet in width were mapped. The 1986 quarterquad basemaps meet NMAS and are orthophotos.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["impervious surface", "land cover", "1997", "Land_lu_1986", "Land_lu_1986", "New Jersey", "change analysis", "NJ", "1986", "wetlands", "NJDEP", "Cowardin", "water quality", "watersheds", "1995", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Anderson", "watershed management areas", "land use", "planningCadastre"], "issued": "2019-07-16T13:34:31.000Z", "modified": "2019-07-16T20:11:54.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Bureau of Geographic Information Systems (BGIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

To improve the performance of the web applications displaying the 2002 land use data, it was necessary to create a new simplified layer that included only the minimum number of polygons and attributes needed to represent the 2002 land use conditions. The 2007 LU/LC data set is the fourth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002 and 2007. This present 2007 update was created by comparing the 2002 LU/LC layer from NJ DEP's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database to 2007 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2007 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2002 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2002-2007 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre.

To improve the performance of the web applications displaying the 2002 land use data, it was necessary to create a new simplified layer that included only the minimum number of polygons and attributes needed to represent the 2002 land use conditions. The 2007 LU/LC data set is the fourth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002 and 2007. This present 2007 update was created by comparing the 2002 LU/LC layer from NJ DEP's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database to 2007 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2007 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2002 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2002-2007 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre. ADVISORY: This metadata file contains information for the 2007Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) data sets, which were mapped by Watershed Management Area (WMA). There are additional reference documents listed in this file under Supplemental Information which should also be examined by users of these data sets.

The purpose of this long-term monitoring network is to monitor on-going quality of the bay and its tributaries. Emphasis is placed on the tributaries that are believed to have the most significant impacts/loading to the bay, as well as diverse land use types. The primary goal of these programs is to assess the nutrient conditions of New Jersey\u2019s coastal waters, evaluate changes in water quality in the Barnegat Bay watershed over time and identify areas undergoing nutrient enrichment. The availability of water quality data provided by this program provides environmental managers and researchers with data to better understand relationships of both anthropogenic and natural ecological impacts on water quality.

The Known Contaminated Sites List (KCSNJ) for New Jersey are those sites and properties within the state where contamination of soil or ground water has been confirmed at levels equal to or greater than applicable standards. This list of Known Contaminated Sites may include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated or has been completed and addressed via an Institutional Control. The KCSLNJ layer has now been modified such that the information portrayed in the GIS layer is updated on a daily basis through a SQL query of NJEMS/Masterfile. Generating the KCSL GIS layer on a daily basis via an SQL query allows for a dynamic KCSL layer. This is critical for the general public and SRP regulated community by allowing them to see the most up to date information for a known contaminated site in a GIS format via NJ Geoweb. A \"live\" KSCNJ report can also be viewed via Data Miner at: 1) Go to https://www13.state.nj.us/DataMiner 2) Select Search by Category 3) Select Site Remediation then Submit 4) Under General, select The Known and Suspected Sites by County for a listing of Known Contaminated Sites by County. Information concerning individual contaminated sites can be viewed via other dataminer reports based on the Site ID or the SRP Preferred Interest # for the SRP case associated with that site. A small number of sites in the KCSL have no X/Y coordinates as of this date and therefore are not included in the GIS version. Also excluded from the KCSL GIS layer are linear construction projects (due to the inability to properly represent the location of these projects with a single coordinate) and sites without confirmed contamination. Both linear construction projects and sites lacking locational coordinates do appear in the tabular dataminer reports. Coordinates for the GIS version of the KSCL were largely \"front door\" locations acquired via \"address matching\" which is an approximation of the facility front door. Many of these locations were also gathered by the Department using GPS equipment and although these tend to be much more accurate, mistakes are sometimes made. Current protocol for assigning site locations defer to the center of the site or center of facility for the coordinates representing the site location. Since errors can occur, users are encouraged to notify the NJDEP/Site Remediation Waste Management Program/Bureau of Information Systems of any inaccuracies in the KCSNJ through email to srpgis@dep.nj.gov.

Included for references are the county and township data. DMZs are updated on an as needed basis. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere. Deer hunters spend more than 100 million dollars each year as they enjoy approximately 1.5 million recreation-days hunting deer. Money spent in the course of deer hunting benefits a wide variety of New Jersey businesses.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has identified over 160 sites that are contaminated with chromite ore processing residue, also known as chromate waste. The chromate chemical production waste has been found at residential, commercial and industrial locations. The more than two million tons of waste disposed of over the area were generated by three chromite ore-processing plants which operated for approximately 70 years between 1905 and 1971. The three plants, located in Hudson County, were owned and operated by:PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) at its former chromium chemical production facility location at Garfield Avenue in Jersey City. The predecessors and subsidiaries of AlliedSignal, Inc. (Allied) previously located on Route 440 in Jersey City The predecessor and subsidiaries of Occidental Chemical Corp., Maxus Energy Corp. and Chemical Land Holding, Inc. previously located on the Belleville Turnpike in KearnyPPG, Allied and Occidental are collectively referred to as the Responsible Entities (REs).The chromate waste from the above facilities was used as fill in preparation for building foundations, construction of tank berms, roadway construction, filling of wetlands, sewerline construction and other construction and development projects. Chromate contamination has been found in a variety of places including the walls and floors of buildings, interior and exterior building surfaces, surfaces of driveways and parking lots and in the surface and subsurface of unpaved areas.Included in this GIS layer are those sites within Hudson and Essex Counties in New Jersey where chromate contamination of soil and/or ground water associated with chrome chemical production waste has been identified. This list of chromate waste sites include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated, has been completed or that were originally deemed a chrome site but further investigation determined that chromate contamination was not present. Additionally, more chromate waste sites may yet be identified and accordingly are not included here. For further information contact NJDEP's Site Remediation Waste Management Program (SRWMP) lead program or the Licensed Site Remediation Professional (LSRP), based on the information provided in the Program attribute field. Contact information for SRWMPs lead program, where applicable, can be acquired at www.nj.gov/dep/srp/about/. Additional information regarding chrome site cleanups can be obtained through https://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/siteinfo/chrome/bkgrnd.htm.The Site Status attribute field will serve to identify the specific category associated with each chrome site. Specific attributes by which the layer is symbolized include the following:Active: Site is an active chrome cleanup case being remediated by one or more of the 3 REs Multi Contaminant: Site is an active chrome cleanup case that is being remediated by the responsible entity that owns the property on which the chromate waste contamination has been identified in conjunction with cleanup efforts for contamination associated with their operations or has agreed to address the chromium contamination present at their property.Post Remedial Monitoring: The chromate waste case has been closed with the issuance of a No Further Action (NFA) or Remedial Action Outcome (RAO) letter with soil and/or groundwater contamination addressed via an Institutional Control (Classification Exception Area for ground water and Deed Notice/Engineering Control for soil). Closed - Unrestricted Use: The chromate waste case has been closed with the issuance of a No Further Action (NFA) or Remedial Action Outcome (RAO) letter with no Institutional Controls required.Not a Chrome Site: Properties that were originally listed as chrome sites based on visual observation/past recollection but later found not to have chromate waste contamination present above standard following sampling.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["soil contamination", "hazardous waste sites", "contamination", "Hexavalent Chrome", "Chromate", "New Jersey", "chromate", "environment", "2018", "pollution", "toxic waste sites", "chromium", "chrome +6", "chromesite", "Hudson County", "hexa-valent chrome", "chrome", "Envr_mon_soil_chromesite_area", "NJDEP", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2019-02-21T19:31:38.000Z", "modified": "2022-03-30T14:05:02.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-74.1582,40.6445,-74.0133,40.7806", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Landfills are well-suited for the development of large solar generation projects. Large-scale solar development can offset the costs to cap or remediate these sites and should be encouraged. Other innovative, large-scale solar installations are on the horizon and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, smaller-scale, grid-connected applications. This layer contains available New Jersey statewide parcels or parcel groups greater than 35 acres in size selected by their affiliation with solid waste landfill sites. This data will provide basic information regarding property location and ID for parcels, or groups of parcels based upon the above critieria. Important information concerning parcel data in New Jersey: The feature class retains the selected attributes from the updated statewide Municipality boundary data and selected attributes from MODIV tabular information received from the counties. This combined layer gives users the ability to have not only basic block and lot data from the parcels, but county and municipality identifiers from the Municipality layer and block/lot ownership data from the MODIV. Please note that attempts will be made to keep the data current, but users should be made aware that more updated information may reside directly with the counties. Any question as to the currentness of the data should be confirmed with the associated county entity. The statewide composite of parcels (cadastral) data for New Jersey was developed during a Parcels Normalization Project in 2009 by the New Jersey Office of Information Technology, Office of GIS (OGIS). The normalized parcels data are compatible with the New Jersey Department of Treasury Property Assessment Management System (PAMS) in development, and the MOD IV system currently used by Tax Assessors. Parcels data in New Jersey currently exist countywide for 19 of 21 counties, and for 8 additional municipalities. This (nearly) statewide composite of parcels data will serve as one of New Jersey's framework GIS data sets. Stewardship and maintenance of the data will continue to be the purview of county and municipal governments, but the statewide composite will be maintained by OGIS. Normalization of the parcels data utilized 2008 statewide municipal boundaries data, provided by OGIS, as the spatial framework within which to align the parcel data. The resulting, normalized parcels data accurately and correctly edgematch at and across municipal boundaries. Improvements to the municipal boundaries data were made during this process. New municipal, county and state boundaries data sets will be released by OGIS once all parcels data have been normalized. Parcel attributes were normalized to a standard structure, specified in the New Jersey GIS Parcel Mapping Standard, to store parcel information and provide a PIN (parcel identification number) field common to the PIN stored in the PAMS database. The standard is available for viewing and download at https://njgin.nj.gov/NJParcelStandards/NJGISParcelMappingStandard.pdf. When complete, 19 countywide and 8 municipal parcel data sets will be available for download from the New Jersey Geographic Information Network (NJGIN) web site download page at https://njgin.state.nj.us/NJ_NJGINExplorer/DataDownloads.jsp. Please note that these parcel data sets are not intended for use as tax maps. They are intended to provide reasonable representations of parcel boundaries for planning and other purposes.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Morris County", "Mercer County", "municipalities", "municipal", "parcels", "Warren County", "Sussex County", "boundaries", "NJDEP", "boundary", "parcel", "New Jersey", "Somerset County", "Util_landfill_sw_parcelgrp", "Atlantic County", "New Jersey", "Cape May County", "municipality", "swl_parcelgrp", "Bergen County", "Util_landfill_sw_parcelgrp", "Passaic County", "Salem County", "Camden County", "Essex County", "block", "county", "Gloucester County", "USA", "njfw_cadastral", "Ocean County", "Hunterdon County", "Burlington County", "Cumberland County", "blocks", "Middlesex County", "Union County", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Monmouth County", "solid waste", "planningCadastre", "Hudson County", "landfill", "lots", "lot", "solid waste landfill", "NJ", "parcel group", "counties"], "issued": "2019-04-01T17:32:58.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:08:19.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP/Solid and Hazardous Waste Program"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5249,39.0145,-73.9877,41.1059", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

CAFRA centers, cores and nodes are those centers, cores and nodes, respectively, that have been adopted by the State Planning Commission and reviewed and accepted by the Department for the purposes of CAFRA. The Department delineated mainland and non-mainland coastal centers, based in part on centers identified in the 1992 State Development and Redevelopment Plan, where the State Planning Commission had not yet designated centers. Delineations were digitized over 1991 orthophotography at a minimum scale of 1:12,000. 1995 orthophotography was used to spot check ground conditions. Certain mainland coastal centers expired on March 15, 2007 in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management rules at N.J.A.C. 7:7E-5B.6. However, the Permit Extension Act extended their expiration until July 1, 2010 subject to certain conditions. As a result, the expiration of the following 12 mainland coastal centers was extended until July 1, 2010: Egg Harbor coastal town, Egg Harbor Township; Town Bank/North Cape May coastal town. Lower Township; Cape May Court House coastal regional center, Del Haven coastal village, Goshen coastal hamlet, Green Creek coastal hamlet, Rio Grande coastal regional center, Swainton coastal hamlet, and Whitesboro/Burleigh coastal village, Middle Township; Barnegat coastal town, Barnegat Township; Toms River coastal regional center, Toms River Township; and Lakewood coastal regional center, Lakewood Township. The mainland coastal centers of West Atlantic City coastal town, Egg Harbor Township and Schellenger's Landing coastal town and Villas coastal village, Lower Township expired on March 15, 2007. These coastal centers are located wholly within environmentally sensitive areas identified under the Act and therefore their expiration was not extended. The official description of the mainland coastal center boundaries is the written description posted on the Department's Permit Extension Act web page https://www.nj.gov/dep/opppc/extension.htm. The description of the non-mainland coastal center boundaries is the written description in Appendix 3 of the Coastal Zone Management rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7E. Boundaries of centers, cores and nodes within the CAFRA area were clipped from the 2001 State Plan Policy Map (cenline2, nodes and cores shape files), as amended through May 18, 2010 and form the boundaries of CAFRA centers, cores and nodes. In 2004, the State Planning Commission adopted rules that set expiration dates for certain State Planning Commission designated centers and cores that were not approved through the plan endorsement process. The expiration dates of these designated centers and cores were modified by operation of law by enactment of the Permit Extension Act of 2008. As a result, certain State Planning Commission designated centers and cores that consisted entirely of environmentally sensitive areas expired in their entirety. Environmentally sensitive portions of other designated centers and cores also expired. In response to the expiration of all or portions of these State Planning Commission designated centers the Department repealed all or portions of the CAFRA centers that correspond to these expired State Planning Commission centers. These areas reverted to the Coastal Planning Area that corresponds to the underlying State Plan Planning Area. The following CAFRA centers were repealed in their entirety: Laurel Lake CAFRA village and Port Norris CAFRA village Commercial Township; and, Delmont CAFRA village, Dorchester-Leesburg CAFRA village, Heislerville CAFRA village and Port Elizabeth Bricksboro CAFRA village, Maurice River Township. Portions of the following CAFRA centers and cores were repealed: Oceanville CAFRA village, Smithville CAFRA town, Smithville CAFRA core, and Wrangleboro CAFRA town, Galloway Township; Wildwood City/North Wildwood City/Wildwood Crest Borough/West Wildwood Borough CAFRA regional center, Wildwood City, North Wildwood City, Wildwood Crest Borough, West Wildwood Borough; Cape May City CAFRA town, Cape May City; Cape May Point CAFRA village, Cape May Point Borough; Bridgeton CAFRA regional center, City of Bridgeton; Cedarville CAFRA village, Lawrence Township; Millville-Vineland CAFRA regional center, Millville City and Vineland City; Mauricetown Station CAFRA hamlet, Maurice River Township; Atlantic Highlands CAFRA town, Atlantic Highlands Borough; Long Branch City CAFRA regional center, Long Branch City; Manasquan Borough CAFRA town, Manasquan Borough; and Red Bank CAFRA Regional Center, Red Bank Borough.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["coast_cafracen", "coastal center", "Cumberland", "Salem", "shore", "Monmouth", "NJDEP", "center", "core", "land management", "coast", "Cape May", "coastal", "Burlington", "Middlesex", "environmental protection", "Land_CAFRA_center_bnd", "New Jersey", "Ocean", "2010", "State Plan", "node", "CAFRA", "oceans", "Atlantic", "CAFRA"], "issued": "2018-12-17T14:17:10.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5576,38.9271,-73.9713,40.4196", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

WHPA delineations are created in compliance to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986 and 1996 as part of the Source Water Area Protection Program (SWAP). The delineations are the first step in defining the sources of water to a public supply well. Within these areas, potential contamination will be assessed and appropriate monitoring will be undertaken as subsequent phases of the NJDEP SWAP. The WHPAs were previously defined using line and polygon coordinate files and the Arc/INFO Generate command. Individual WHPAs were then combined into county and statewide coverages with the Arc/INFO Union command. The WHPAs are currently created using the same coordinate files using a Python-based feature creation script producing an ArcGIS geodatabase feature. The individual features are then combined using ArcGIS merge command. Previous WHPA coverages were updated to features also and combined into a statewide WHPA feature.

Each numbered grid is a 14.288 square mile projection. DMU's used in conjunction with Deer Management Zones (DMZ) by hunters identifying their location in the DMZ. The DMU is the most smallest and most detailed spatial reference used in deer management, i.e. monitoring disease outbreaks. Please note that initial data generation and creation procedures produced various missing grid numbers (222, 231, 244, 414, 550-559) and some grid order issues. Because of pre-existing use of that data in hunting and for data continuity, these have not been corrected. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere. Deer hunters spend more than 100 million dollars each year as they enjoy approximately 1.5 million recreation-days hunting deer. Money spent in the course of deer hunting benefits a wide variety of New Jersey businesses.

These are defined by the EPA as those aquifers that contribute more than 50 percent of the drinking water to a specific area and the water would be impossible to replace if the aquifer were contaminated. Sole-source aquifers are defined with guidelines set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as authorized in section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water act of 1974. Any federally-funded project in an area that could affect ground-water in a sole-source aquifer must be reviewed by the US EPA. This 'project review area' includes the aquifer's 'recharge zone' and it's 'stream-flow source zone'. The recharge zone is the area through which water recharges the aquifer. The source zone is the upstream area that contributes recharge water to the aquifer. The EPA sometimes modifies the project review areas as published in the Federal Register in order to better protect zone as originally published. Most of New Jersey is covered by the seven SSAs and their project review areas. Descriptions of the SSAs can be found in Entity and Attribute information. This is based on notifications published in the Federal Register. The order of chronological approval is as follows: 1.) Buried Valley SSA 2.) Ridgewood SSA 3.) Rockaway SSA 4.) Highlands SSA 5.) Northwest New Jersey SSA 6.) Coastal Plain SSA 7.) Ramapo SSA The sole source aquifer program is a federal program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water Act. All questions about the program should be addressed to them. EPA's reference for the sole source aquifers in New Jersey is at: https://www.epa.gov/region2/water/aquifer/ This data contains polygons of the sole-source aquifers for New Jersey that are approved as of December 2008. The coverage was built by the N.J. Geological Survey from standard GIS files of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic units, New Jersey state and municipal boundaries, and aquifers.

The Division, under authority of the Fish and Game Council designates these boundaries. Deer Management Zone boundaries are comprised of major and minor roads, waterways and geographic formations. Included for references are the county and township data. DMZs are updated on an as needed basis. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere. Deer hunters spend more than 100 million dollars each year as they enjoy approximately 1.5 million recreation-days hunting deer. Money spent in the course of deer hunting benefits a wide variety of New Jersey businesses.

Specifically, the road-stream crossing assessments have tremendous utility as a component of the Division of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s Connecting Habitat Across New Jersey (CHANJ, www.CHANJ.nj.gov) project. When the completed road-stream assessments are integrated with the CHANJ mapping, they can help identify opportunities to improve safe passage for wildlife in areas that occur within mapped wildlife habitat cores and corridors.

The BMWM laboratory will specifically focus on identifying toxin producing and dominant species for each water sample. In addition, cell counts are performed to provide an indication if a potential algal bloom is present. If cell counts or species type indicate a possible bloom, BMWM staff will be strategically deployed to conduct additional sample monitoring to identify the extent of the bloom and whether conditions are improving over time.

This monthly report also includes facilities operating in public schools (FOIPS) although these facilities are not required in most cases to submit environmental data to the NJDEP for NJDCF licensing. Proposed child care centers are not listed until a NJDCF License number is issued. ADVISORY: This data was created only to be used as guidance to find active child care centers. The data should not be used as the determining factor in conducting receptor evaluations and the actions taken to protect them. The child care data will be updated on a monthly basis as monthly updates of active child care facilities operation in New Jersey are provided to the NJDEP SRWMP by the NJDCF Office of Licensing. Users are hereby notified that data on NJDEP mapping applications for this data set may be more current than any downloadable shapefile, if provided.", "keyword": ["Children and Families", "providers", "centers", "children", "child care", "society", "NJDEP", "New Jersey", "Strc_DCF_childcare", "DCF", "NJDCF", "Department of Children and Families", "NJ", "daycare", "childcare", "childcare_centers", "DYFS", "day care", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2018-08-16T13:33:06.000Z", "modified": "2023-02-12T09:24:13.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP/SRWMP/BIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5538,38.9628,-73.9255,41.2217", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>ADVISORY: This data was created only to be used as guidance to find active child care centers.

CKEs are geographically defined areas within which the local ground water resources are known to be compromised because the water quality exceeds drinking water and ground water quality standards for specific contaminants. Historically, a number of the CKEs have also been identified as Well Restriction Areas (WRAs). The regulatory authority for developing CKEs is in N.J.A.C. 7:1J, entitled Processing of Damage Claims Pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act. CKEs are used by NJDEP staff, water purveyors, and local officials to make decisions concerning appropriate treatment and/or replacement of contaminated drinking water supplies. Additional guidance on the mapping of CKEs for potable well Immediate Environmental Concerns (IECs) can be found in Section 4.1.6. and Appendix A of the NJDEP Site Remediation Program IEC Guidance Document. The CKE areas, as shown, are intended to provide information to the public about contaminated ground water areas in the state. Unless precautionary measures are taken to protect potable users, well installation should be avoided. This information is being made available so informed decisions can be made on well location, design, or treatment before wells are proposed, permitted, and installed. The Department is currently engaged in the reassessment and investigation of existing CKEs; however, it is important to note that CKEs are approximations of the actual aerial extent of ground water contamination and the boundaries presented here may change over time as new information is developed and plume migration occurs. At this time, the records of the CKEs in this database application may include a list of the specific ground water contaminants where available. Also, it should be noted that CKE areas might overlap with other CKEs and Classification Exception Areas (CEAs). Revisions and additions will be used to update the CKE database as new information is received and processed. In this application, the CKE is represented as a GIS-based polygon coverage that depicts the spatial extent of known potable well contamination in an area (as determined by NJDEP Site Remediation staff). The CKE polygon will usually follow the property boundary lines of all the contiguous properties with contaminated wells when the wells are within 1,000 feet of each other. However, on properties larger than 3.5 acres the boundary of the CKE may be based on the location of the contaminated well and may not encompass the entire property. Also, in some areas contaminated wells may have been detected in proximity to an established CKE but have not been included within the boundary of the CKE because the well is outside the 1,000 foot radius. For further information contact NJDEPs Site Remediation Waste Management Program (SRWMP), Bureau of Environmental Management and Site Assessment (BEMSA), the lead program for CKE case oversight at (609) 530-2474. Be advised that CKEs have not been created for IECs where public supply wells that have been impacted by ground water contamination and a CKE has not yet been developed for all areas where a domestic potable well IEC exists.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["human and environmental health", "well restriction area", "GWIA", "contaminants", "well restriction", "New Jersey", "cke", "Contamination", "Envr_mon_gw_CKE", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "aquifers", "environment", "environment", "oil spill", "unknown source", "gwia", "polygon", "wra", "plume", "WRA", "Groundwater", "NJDEP", "pollution", "IEC", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2016-08-18T14:00:51.000Z", "modified": "2023-02-01T16:30:45.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Site Remediation Program (SRP), Bureau of Information Systems (BIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.3122,39.0223,-73.9262,41.3135", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

This particular product was initially developed for the Connecticut River watershed as part of the Connect the Connecticut project (www.connecttheconnecticut.org) \u2014 a collaborative partnership under the auspices of the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NALCC), and subsequently developed for the entire Northeast region as part of the Nature's Network project (www.naturesnetwork.org). The HUC6 terrestrial core-connector network represents a set of terrestrial core areas and the connectors between them (Fig. 1). In combination with the aquatic core areas, they spatially represent the ecological network designed to provide strategic guidance for conserving natural areas, and the fish, wildlife, and other components of biodiversity that they support within the Northeast.Core areas serve as the foundation of the LCD. They reflect decisions by the LCD planning team about the highest priority areas for sustaining the long-term ecological values of the landscape, based on currently available, regional-scale information. In this product the terrestrial core areas represent the following:1) areas of relatively high ecological integrity across all terrestrial and wetland ecosystem types and geophysical settings, emphasizing areas that are relatively intact (i.e., free from human modifications and disturbance) and resilient to environmental changes (e.g., climate change). Integrity has the potential to remain high in these areas, both in the short-term due to connectivity to similar natural environments, and in the long-term due to proximity to diverse landforms and other geophysical settings;2) areas of relatively high current landscape capability for a suite of representative (a.k.a. surrogate species) terrestrial wildlife species, emphasizing areas that provide the best habitat and climate conditions today; and3) areas of rare terrestrial natural communities that support unique biodiversity, regardless of their landscape context; inclusive of communities listed by state heritage programs as S1 (extremely rare), S2 (rare), and S3 (uncommon), with definitions ofS1-S3 varying slightly among states.Core areas were built from focal areas (\u201cseeds\u201d) within each HUC6 watershed that have high value based on one or more of the attributes listed above. These \u201cseeds\u201d were expanded to encompass surrounding areas that provide additional ecological value and resilience to both short- and long-term change. The surrounding areas were typically of high to moderate ecological value. In some cases the final core areas contained low-intensity development and minor roads, but high-intensity development and major roads were excluded. Collectively, the terrestrial core areas identified in this product encompass ~25% of the Northeast, as decided by the LCD planning team, including a total of 20,358 disjunct core areas encompassing a total of 16,160,371 ha and ranging in size from 3.6 to 107,996 ha, with an average size of 794 ha.Connectors represent \u201ccorridors\u201d that could facilitate the movement of plants and animals (i.e., ecological flow) between terrestrial core areas. These connectors increase the resiliency of the core area network to uncertain land use and climate changes. They are wider where more movement between cores is expected because of larger, higher-quality, and closer core areas and where a more favorable natural environment exists between them. Connectors primarily link adjoining core areas along routes that possess the greatest ecological similarity to the ecosystems in the adjoining cores; they do not necessarily represent travel corridors for any individual species. Connectors may traverse through areas of low-density development and cross roads of all classes, but they do not include high-intensity development. Connectors are not identified between core areas that are greater than 10 km apart. Collectively, connectors encompass an additional ~17% of the Northeast.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ", "NJDEP", "environment", "public", "Envr_NERCP_terrestrial_core", "New Jersey", "HUC6", "NJ", "core areas", "New Jersey", "environment", "terrestrial", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-11-22T19:03:35.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-22T19:03:38.755Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Office of Fish and Wildlife Information Systems."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5491,38.9289,-73.8982,41.3529", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Due to overharvesting and habitat degradation and loss, horseshoe crab populations declined and a moratorium on horseshoe crab harvest was imposed in New Jersey in 2008. Recovery efforts are currently underway. One ongoing conservation program is reTURN the Favor (RTF), a large-scale citizen science project where volunteers walk transects of spawning beaches, rescuing horseshoe crabs that have been stranded, overturned, or trapped in natural or manmade impingement hazards before these crabs die from exposure or predation. Derived from RTF volunteer records, this data documents known horseshoe crab spawning beaches on the Delaware Bayshore and the number of crabs rescued by volunteer efforts after being overturned or trapped in different impingements on those beaches. This provides a foundation for identifying structures that constitute a hazard to horseshoe crabs and understanding the relative importance of different beaches and potential impingements in horseshoe crab survival.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["derelict house", "jetty", "outfall pipe", "marine debris", "rubble", "Envr_mon_horseshoecrab_stats", "Limulus polyphemus", "horseshoe crab", "riprap", "impingement", "Delaware Bay", "overturned crabs", "overwash", "spawning habitat", "beach", "NJDEP", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-08-24T15:59:57.000Z", "modified": "2022-08-24T16:03:20.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.3216,38.9594,-74.8909,39.3265", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The original \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s Recreational and Commercial Ocean Fishing Grounds\u201d charts were first created in 1982 with a second printing in 1984. In 2003, the Division of Fish and Wildlife's Bureau of Marine Fisheries, with funding from the Coastal Management Program, updated the map in digital format for inclusion in the Department's Geographic Information System. The updating of the map was accomplished through direct interviews with recreational fishing boat captains. Prime recreational fishing grounds identified in the various publications referenced in the rule and commercially prepared sport fishing charts (Homeport Charts and Charter Boat Charts) were transferred onto two sets of NOAA nautical charts, which served as the working or base map. For fishing grounds within 20 nautical miles of the coast, NOAA nautical charts Series 12326, 12323, 12318 and 12214 at a scale of 1:80,000 were used. For fishing beyond 20 nautical miles NOAA nautical charts Series 12200 and 12300 at a scale of 1:400,000 were used. During the summer of 2003, 28 party boat captains, 47 charter boat captains and 22 private boat captains from each fishing port (inlet) along the Atlantic Coast of New Jersey were interviewed by Department staff. These recreational fishing party boat, charter boat and private boat captains were selected because they fish the ocean waters on a daily basis using a wide variety of methods to catch a variety of fish species. The interview process entailed examining the accuracy of the already delineated prime fishing areas on the base map. Fishermen modified the base map by drawing their changes on the map. In general, modifications to the boundaries of the prime fishing areas resulted in an increase to the size of the prime fishing area. In a similar fashion, the captains drew new prime fishing areas on the base maps. The revised base maps were then digitized into the New Jersey Specific Sport Ocean Fishing Grounds Coverage. In 2018, the NJ Bureau of Marine Fisheries again updated the New Jersey Prime Fishing Grounds to include all current 17 artificial reef sites, and updated Homeport Charts. Under the DEP\u2019s plan to balance access, regulations have set aside a portion of the Sandy Hook Reef and two sections of the Axel Carlson Reef as Full Access Zones. These are areas where persons may use, leave, deploy, or tend lobster conch, fish pot gear.   Recreational hook and line anglers are not prohibited from utilizing the Full Access Zones for fishing. The use of fixed gear is prohibited on all other reef sites as they are all deemed Special Management Zones by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Service as well as Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council. The use of fixed gear on any reef or portion of a reef not explicitly defined is prohibited and punishable by law (N.J.A.C. 7:25-18.5A). The 1nm buffer polygons were incorporated to represent the entire surrounding area where fishing opportunity associated with each point feature may occur.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ Prime Fishing Grounds", "Artificial Reef Sites", "ocean", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Envr_admin_fish_prime_bnd", "Reef Boundaries", "Reef", "Oceans", "Boundaries", "NJDEP", "New Jersey", "NJ"], "issued": "2019-02-01T15:42:14.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-20T15:24:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Marine Fisheries"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.0942,37.2480,-71.2166,41.0792", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The original \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s Recreational and Commercial Ocean Fishing Grounds\u201d charts were first created in 1982 with a second printing in 1984. In 2003, the Division of Fish and Wildlife's Bureau of Marine Fisheries, with funding from the Coastal Management Program, updated the map in digital format for inclusion in the Department's Geographic Information System. The updating of the map was accomplished through direct interviews with recreational fishing boat captains. Prime recreational fishing grounds identified in the various publications referenced in the rule and commercially prepared sport fishing charts (Homeport Charts and Charter Boat Charts) were transferred onto two sets of NOAA nautical charts, which served as the working or base map. For fishing grounds within 20 nautical miles of the coast, NOAA nautical charts Series 12326, 12323, 12318 and 12214 at a scale of 1:80,000 were used. For fishing beyond 20 nautical miles NOAA nautical charts Series 12200 and 12300 at a scale of 1:400,000 were used. During the summer of 2003, 28 party boat captains, 47 charter boat captains and 22 private boat captains from each fishing port (inlet) along the Atlantic Coast of New Jersey were interviewed by Department staff. These recreational fishing party boat, charter boat and private boat captains were selected because they fish the ocean waters on a daily basis using a wide variety of methods to catch a variety of fish species. The interview process entailed examining the accuracy of the already delineated prime fishing areas on the base map. Fishermen modified the base map by drawing their changes on the map. In general, modifications to the boundaries of the prime fishing areas resulted in an increase to the size of the prime fishing area. In a similar fashion, the captains drew new prime fishing areas on the base maps. The revised base maps were then digitized into the New Jersey Specific Sport Ocean Fishing Grounds Coverage. In 2018, the NJ Bureau of Marine Fisheries again updated the New Jersey Prime Fishing Grounds to include all current 17 artificial reef sites, and updated Homeport Charts.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ Prime Fishing Grounds", "Artificial Reef Sites", "NJ Prime Fishing Grounds Points", "ocean", "New Jersey", "Envr_admin_fish_reef", "Reef Boundaries", "Reef", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Oceans", "Boundaries", "NJDEP", "New Jersey", "NJ"], "issued": "2019-02-01T15:55:56.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-20T15:24:40.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Marine Fisheries"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.0881,38.8319,-73.6813,40.3897", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The purpose is to create a network of artificial reefs in the ocean waters along the New Jersey coast to provide a hard substrate for fish, shellfish and crustaceans, fishing grounds for anglers, and underwater structures for scuba divers. Within each reef site, which range in size from one-half to over four square miles, numerous deployments or \"patch reefs\" have been constructed. A patch reef is an area within a reef site boundary where material has been deployed. In total, over 4000 patch reefs have been constructed on the state's 17 reef sites since the program began. Reefs are used extensively by anglers and divers who catch summer flounder, winter flounder, ling, black sea bass, tautog, scup, and lobster along with a myriad of other species.Deployments most often consist of three material types; concrete, rock, and metals. These deployments are frequently old bridges, dredge rock, or ships which have all been repurposed as artificial habitat. Over time, these materials become encrusted and a living reef matrix envelopes the structure. This matrix can be several layers thick as different types of encrusters compete for an available toehold, often growing on top of each other. At this stage of reef development, a multitude of minute organisms take up residence in this protective matrix and form an important component of the food chain. Deployed reef structure not only leads to more food for marine fish, but also increases the energy efficiency of reef feeding by dissipating underwater currents. The structure acts as a baffle, reducing current along the bottom, which allows energy from food to be used for growth rather than exertion. Additionally, as water flows over and around reef structure, eddies form, which carry food to waiting fishes.The DGPS coordinates upon which this GIS data is based were obtained through direct observation, i.e. by finding each structure at sea and then recording its exact location from LORAN C and DGPS receivers. Older patch reef coordinates were obtained using LORAN C devices. More recent reef drops were recorded with DGPS machines. To convert the earlier reef deployment coordinates that were obtained solely from LORAN C devices into DPGS, two techniques were used. Most of the conversions were obtained by on-site observations. If an on-site observation was not possible, mathematical equations were used to convert from Loran C into DGPS. Unfortunately, while close, these conversions are usually not accurate enough to find reef structures. The exact locations of structures can usually be found by using a wreck search patterns.This dataset includes all deployments located at reef sites and installed between 1905-2016 as well as deployments installed after 2016 which were sponsored.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ", "NJDEP", "new jersey", "New Jersey", "nj", "Deployment", "Envr_admin_fish_reef_deployment", "wreck", "reef", "artificial reef", "ocean", "oceans", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-06-08T14:15:51.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-20T15:24:27.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Fish and Wildlife (FW), Office of Fish and Wildlife Information Systems"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.0786,38.8393,-73.6815,40.3894", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Specifically, springs are places where subsurface water comes to the surface from the ground and flows or where it lies in pools that are continually replenished from below. Thus, a spring is a site where the aquifer surface meets the ground surface. The water source for a spring can vary. Some springs are fed by shallow groundwater seepage out of the soil, while others are fed by deep aquifer water discharged under artesian pressure. These differences influence the hydrology and the water chemistry of springs. They range in size from intermittent seeps, which flow only after a great deal of rain, to huge spring pools with tens of thousands of gallons flowing daily. Springs may be permanent (perennial) and flow throughout the year, or ephemeral (intermittent or temporary) and flow only during or after rain. Where evaporation is high, the flow of springs can decrease or cease during the warm season. The amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including: the size of the caverns (or porosity) within the rocks, the water pressure in the aquifer, the size of the spring basin, and the amount of rainfall. Human activities can also influence the volume of water that discharges from a spring. Ground-water withdrawals in an area can reduce the pressure in an aquifer, causing water levels in the aquifer system to drop and ultimately decreasing the flow from the spring. In some cases, springs have completely disappeared over time due to water withdrawal from urbanization. It is thought that half of all the springs in the United States have dried up since settlement of the country began. New Jersey has many examples of springs which once flowed but do not exist anymore.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["surficial", "NJDEP", "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection", "New Jersey Geological Survey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Hydr_spring", "New Jersey", "water", "NJGS", "NJGWS", "geology", "State of New Jersey", "geoscientificInformation", "njsprings", "spring"], "issued": "2019-07-15T17:18:15.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-11T15:58:01.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), New Jersey Geological and Water Survey (NJGWS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5030,38.9709,-73.9963,41.3186", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Waters are classified in one of five categories: Prohibited - harvest not allowed under any conditions. Special Restricted - harvest allowed with a special permit requiring further purification of the shellfish before sale. Seasonal (Nov - Apr) - and Seasonal (Jan - Apr) - where harvest is permitted only during certain seasons of the year. The final category is Approved - harvest permitted under any conditions. Classification of the waters is based on the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. As specified in this program, classifications are based on three components: 1) Regular monitoring of water quality 2) Field surveys of shoreline conditions 3) Study of water currents and flows (hydrography). These functions are performed by New Jersey's Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring which monitors about 2,500 locations a minimum of five times a year. Please note: Shellfish water classifications in this theme may be temporarily superseded by an emergency closure order. The Department may suspend harvest in areas impacted by an intermittent pollution episode or emergency condition when the event has or may have a deleterious impact on public health. Public notice will be provided of any emergency closures.

The citation as adopted September 18, 1989. There are numerous current shellfish leases that were established prior to the adoption of this rule. If one of these Cape Horn leases become vacated, the vacated parcel may not be re-leased. The area was digitzied within GIS using landmarks and navigation aids depicted on the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d. The 1986 version of the chart used for the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d has since been updated.Goosebar Lease Exclusion Area - Regulatory area pertaining to shellfish leases: no leases allowed in area defined as the Goosebar in Little Egg Harbor Bay.Lakes Bay Lease Exclusion Area - Lakes Bay is an area defined by the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations as an area classified as productive in which leasing is discouraged (NJAC 7:25-24.6(d)1iii.

The Shellfish Council had made several policy decisions in regard to leasing limiting additional new leases, but maintaining existing leases or eliminating certain leases that may go vacant that were established prior to the Council\u2019s policies. These policy decisions can be found on the \u201cLeasing Policy of the Atlantic Coast Section of the New Jersey Shellfisheries Council.\u201d In addition, waters classified as productive hard clam habitat are discouraged from leasing as per the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations at NJAC 7:25-24. The area was digitized in GIS based upon the NJDEP's 2015 Landuse/Landcover dataset and using geographic landmarks to delineate waterbodies defined by Council policy and areas considered productive for hard clams.Graveling Beds - Regulatory area pertaining to NJ Atlantic coast shellfish leases: no leases allowed in mapped area.The Graveling Beds are an area defined under Title 50 and the Atlantic Coast Harvest Season regulations NJAC 7:25-19. No leases are allowed in the Graveling beds. There are five main oyster reef lumps in this region known as the Graveling Beds which consist of Fitney Bit, Reef Bed, Oyster Bed Point Bed, Turtle Island Beds and an unnamed lump near Goose Cove. These beds are located within a boundary known as the Graveling Beds.

The NJ Trails Taskforce is currently developing a process to maintain, fill in data gaps, and make the dataset more robust over time There is no authoritative central location for the public to access Trail locations online. Many independently owned websites offer this information, but it is often crowd sourced and therefore may not be accurate. If the state hosted and maintained the NJ Statewide Trails GIS data then the general public, landowners, land managers, and first responders would have a reliable place to look for this information. Data can be used for planning new trails, advocating for use, search and rescue, and more. NOTE: Managing agency will still be primary point of contact for the most accurate, up-to-date trail locations and conditions. Users of the data will be able to see where trails are in relation to their area of interest. Users can use trail data to plan hiking trips and create routes. Data can be used on maps to show location of trails when relevant or used in analysis. First responders can use data to find lost hikers. There is also a benefit statewide \u2013 data can be used as a statewide trail planning tool to improve New Jersey\u2019s trail network. For Green Acres and others involved in land preservation, this data will assist in the identification of parcel acquisitions needed to connect larger trail systems, and it will allow the Trails Program to effectively evaluate project proposals. For the Office of Environmental Justice, the environmental justice mapping tool can be used in conjunction with this database to target efforts in overburdened communities where trails or access to trails are limited or nonexistent. For the State Park Service, this data will allow land managers to make trail connections to adjacent properties to improve the trail network, and the data can be used on existing maps to show trails that neighbor park properties. For the New Jersey State Police, Search and Rescue efforts can be aided using this data.

Displayed are all polygons that have a TYPE02 code of 'WETLANDS'. While these wetland delineations are not regulatory lines, they represent important resource data in identifying potential wetland areas. These wetland data have a somewhat involved delineation history. Non-tidal wetlands were first mapped in a separate effort under the Freshwater Wetlands Mapping Program (FWW), based on 1986 photography. Although the original FWW maps were produced as a separate data set, they were incorporated into a state wide composite land use/land cover (LU/LC) data set also being initially mapped from the 1986 photography. The FWW delineations were integrated into the LU/LC data layer in their entirety as originally delineated, with all line work and coding intact. The tidal wetlands were being mapped as part the LU/LC mapping effort itself. This integrated data set, including the FWW delineations, and the remaining land use/land cover delineations for areas outside of the FWW polygons, which included tidal wetland areas, became the initial 1986 LU/LC layer for the NJDEP. Beginning in 1995, NJDEP acquired new aerial imagery, and began updating the initial integrated LU/LC layer from 1986 based on this newer imagery. The 1986 layer was examined with the new imagery, and areas of change delineated, with any new line work and land use codes needed to map the changes added to the base data set. This updated LU/LC layer is identified as Land Use 1995 in this application. Included in the change analysis were any non-tidal wetland polygons mapped in the original FWW mapping effort, as well as any tidal wetland polygons mapped in the 1986 LU/LC mapping effort. More recently, new photography was acquired in the spring of 2002, and this photography was used in a second land use update project. The Land Use 1995 layer was examined over the 2002 imagery, and an updated layer based on the 2002 imagery was created, available in this application as 'Land Use 2002'. The layer displayed here is the selection of all wetlands, both tidal and non-tidal, as included in that 2002 land use layer. As with all original wetland delineations delineations, this data set is intended to serve as a resource for analysis rather than regulatory delineations. The NJDEP may change the line work of any wetlands polygon based on more in depth analysis and field inspection for regulatory purposes.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["wma", "land use/land cover", "WMA", "Land_lu_2002_wetland", "watersheds", "NJ", "1997", "watershed management areas", "planningCadastre", "Land_lu_2002_wetland", "impervious surface", "wetlands", "njfw_lulc", "NJDEP", "2002", "Cowardin", "1995", "water quality", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "wet02", "New Jersey", "change analysis", "Anderson"], "issued": "2019-04-24T18:27:36.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:59.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Bureau of Geographic Information Systems (BGIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5873,38.9258,-73.9022,41.3568", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The 2012 LU/LC data set is the fifth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002, 2007 and 2012. This present 2012 update was created by comparing the 2007 LU/LC layer from NJDEP's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database to 2012 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2012 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2007 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2007-2012 can be undertaken from this one layer.

Some of the mapped canals and raceways are located on private property with no public access. Other canals and raceways allow public access on the canal itself or neighboring pathways, for recreational purposes. The user of this product is responsible for determining if a canal or raceway is open to the public before visiting. This data does not include dewatering canals and ditches with two exceptions, the Berry's Creek Canal and the Old Canal. They were included in this data because they are navigable. Channelized streams and underground aqueducts are not included in this shapefile. The New Jersey Geological Survey is interested in updating this product.

This version corrects 290 overlapping topology errors which were extremely small and visually undetectable. The 14-digit hydrologic units (HUC14s) in New Jersey is a revision of the 2006 version of these units. This version corrects some boundaries to be consistent with a new hydrography coverage based on 1:2,400 aerial photographs (NJDEP, 2008). It also makes some changes to be more consistent with a new 12-digit hydrologic unit coverage (EPA, 2009). This editing process created 42 new HUC14s, deleted one inland HUC14 and five coastal HUC14s in the Delaware Bay, and changed over 100 boundaries. A report detailing these changes (Hoffman and Pallis, 2009) is available online . For programmatic reasons the 14-digit units are clipped to New Jersey's political boundary. HUC14 hydrologic units were first published by Ellis and Price (1995) and made available as a shape file by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection soon afterword. Watershed boundaries were based on elevations and water courses from 1:24,000-scale (7.5-minute) USGS quadrangles. These were revised (NJDEP, 2006) by clipping the unit boundaries to the official NJ state boundary and addition of some additional identification information. Some boundaries were changed at that time to reflect errors found in the original coverage. This product is an interim product and will be replaced once better elevational data are available. It is based on elevational data from quadrangle maps at a scale of 1:24,000. The hydrography is at 1:2,400. Once high-resolution LiDAR data (at 1:2,400 or better) become available for New Jersey the 14-digit hydrologic units will be redrawn and this interim coverage will be replaced. EPA's 12-digit hydrologic system (USEPA, 2009) uses a numbering convention that is not entirely consistent with the 14-digit numbering system. For some HUC14s, the first 12 digits do not match the identification number of the 12-digit hydrologic unit it lies within. These discrepancies will be corrected when the HUC14s are next revised.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Hydr_HUC14_bnd", "environmental protection", "NJDEP", "drainage basin", "inlandWaters", "HUC14", "hydrology", "State of", "dephuc14", "New Jersey", "hydrologic-unit codes", "hydrologic", "hydrologic units", "subwatershed", "huc14", "watershed", "HUC"], "issued": "2018-12-17T14:25:06.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:13.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJ Dept. of Environmental Protection, (NJDEP), NJ Geological Survey (NJGS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5934,38.8493,-73.8597,41.3576", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Soils become naturally acidic for three major reasons: rainfall and leaching, acidic parent material, and decay of organic matter which produces hydrogen ions. Sulfide-bearing (pyritic) Cretaceous and Cenozoic marine and estuarine sediments, depicted on this map, are potential acid-soil producers. The development of acid-sulfate soils occurs when sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and/or elemental sulfur, in reduced sulfidic sediments, oxidize upon air exposure through drainage or earth-moving operations. The overall acid-sulfate soil-forming process involves a complex chain of reactions that connect the oxidation of iron sulfides to the release of iron oxyhydrates (+ hydronium jarosite, H3OFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6) and sulfuric acids. For pyrite and marcasite, the overall reaction is: FeS2 + 3.75O2 + 3.5 H2O -&gt; Fe(OH)3 + 2H2SO4 (pyrite/marcasite) (iron oxyhydrate) (sulfuric acid) Acid-sulfate soil formation occurs if the reduced sulfur components exceed the acid-neutralizing capacity of adsorbed bases and easily weatherable silicate and carbonate minerals. Natural Resource Conservation Service reports (see for example Soil Survey of Monmouth County) demonstrate that soils developed on these sulfidic, non-calcareous, marine sediments are strongly (pH &lt; 5.5) to extremely acid (pH &lt; 4.5). Depicted on the geologic map are the sedimentary units with the potential to produce acid (sulfate) soils: Kirkwood, Shark River, Manasquan, Hornerstown, Tinton, Sandy Hook Member of the Red Bank, Navesink, Wenonah, Marshalltown, Englishtown, Woodbury, Merchantville, Cheesequake, Magothy, and Raritan Formations.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["geology", "bedrock", "acid", "geoscientificInformation", "soils", "NJGWS", "New Jersey", "Geol_soil_acidsoil", "NJDEP", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2019-07-03T17:26:44.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:06:50.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey Geological Survey"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5745,39.4156,-73.9708,40.5746", "license": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

This map shows areas of historic fill covering more than approximately 5 acres. For the purposes of this map, historic fill is non-indigenous material placed on a site in order to raise the topographic elevation of the site. No representation is made as to the composition of the fill or presence of contamination in the fill. Some areas mapped as fill may contain chemical-production waste or ore-processing waste that exclude them from the legislative definition of historic fill. Fill was mapped from stereo aerial photography taken in March 1979, supplemented in places by planimetric aerial photography taken in the spring of 1991 and 1992. Additional areas of fill were mapped by comparing areas of swamp, marsh, and floodplain shown on archival topographic and geologic maps on file at the N. J. Geological Survey, dated between 1840 and 1910, to their modern extent. In a few places, fill was mapped from field observations and from drillers' logs of wells and borings. Most urban and suburban areas are underlain by a discontinuous layer of excavated indigenous soil mixed with varying amounts of non-indigenous material. This material generally does not meet the definition of historic fill and is not depicted on this map. Also, there may be historic fills that are not detectable on aerial photography or by archival map interpretation and so are not shown on this map, particularly along streams in urban and suburban areas. As of this January 2016 edition, twelve new quadrangles were added to the statewide coverage.

That is if any of the data sources are impaired for a parameter, then the parameter is impaired at the AU level. If some data sources are fully attaining for a parameter but others have insufficient data, the parameter is fully attaining. The data reflects which of three assessment results each assessment was assigned: Attaining- Fully Supporting, Insufficient Data- Insufficient data was available to assess, Non-Attaining- Non-Supporting. Since it was not possible to show fish consumption advisories and the spatial extent of many fish tissue sampling sites, only the AU level assessment results are mapped. The 303(d) List includes the impairment source for non-supporting Fish Consumption parameters. Because of the large number of parameters associated with fish consumption, if a parameter had insufficient data for an assessment throughout the state then the parameter was removed from the file. The result was a reduction from 62 parameters to 28 parameters that had sufficient data for an assessment.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["Designated Use", "water", "2016 New Jersey Integrated Report", "assessment", "Water Quality Inventory", "New Jersey", "Water Quality Assessment", "305 (b)", "Use Assessments", "Statewide Water Quality", "Envr_mon_IR_2016_fish", "monitoring", "Fish Consumption", "inlandWaters", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "NJDEP"], "issued": "2020-06-08T13:42:53.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:05:44.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP, Division of Water Monitoring and Standards (DWMS), Bureau of Environmental Analysis, Restoration and Standards (BEARS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5991,38.8576,-73.8904,41.3578", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Drought regions provide a regulatory basis for coordinating local responses to regional water-supply shortages. The six drought regions are based on watershed and water-supply considerations. Drought region boundaries coincide with municipal boundaries as referenced by the N.J. Dept of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Each municipality in New Jersey is assigned to a drought region based on the watershed covering and supplying water to the municipality. Each data record of the file includes name of the drought region. This is the second version of the drought regions. It differs from the original delineation in two ways: 1) The number of drought regions were expanded from five to six in order to account for water-supply issues identified for the New Jersey coastal plain. The original version included the north part of the Coastal Plain in the central region. Version 2 separates a north coastal region, consisting of Monmouth and northern Ocean Counties, from the coastal region to the south. 2) Municipalities in Mercer County receiving water from the Trenton Water Dept. were moved into the southwest region from the northwest. Pennington and Hopewell boroughs were also moved to the southwest region. This is the third version of the drought regions and was released in May 2004. There are two changes from the second version. Roosevelt Boro in Monmouth County was moved to the southwest drought region (from the coastal north) and Berlin Twp in Camden County was moved to the coastal south drought region (from the southwest). Both changes were made in recognition of the location of actual water supply to these municipalities.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["NJGS", "Envr_admin_drought_bnd", "State of", "NJDEP", "njdrought", "New Jersey", "drought", "water management", "none", "drought regions", "environment", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2018-12-19T17:08:58.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5873,38.9248,-73.8904,41.3576", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Without that ability to move, long-term viability of populations is in jeopardy. New Jersey is facing increasing habitat loss and fragmentation from steady urbanization, a dense network of roads, and a changing climate that are compromising the connectivity of habitat and resiliency of wildlife populations. Connecting Habitat Across New Jersey (CHANJ) represents a statewide habitat connectivity plan, developed in collaboration with a multi-partner, multi-disciplinary working group representing over 40 different agencies across the state, convened by the ENSP to address the importance of landscape permeability for the persistence of native terrestrial wildlife species. CHANJ mapping identifies core terrestrial wildlife habitat and corridors connecting them across the state, as well as intersecting road segments that serve as road barrier mitigation opportunities. The mapping is based on a naturalness index approach, and utilized core and corridor delineation GIS toolsets, Core Mapper and Linkage Mapper (www.circuitscape.org). Terrestrial species location data were used to inform model parameters and for validation. The mapping was developed using raster data (10m and 20m grid cell sizes for the cores and corridors respectively), and then converted to polygons for the final product. The core, corridor, and road segment elements in the mapping link to a guidance document that provides recommendations and resources for restoring and maintaining those key areas for wildlife connectivity through strategic land preservation, habitat management, and road barrier mitigation.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Cores", "New Jersey", "CHANJ", "Envr_CHANJ", "New Jersey", "Connecting Habitat Across New Jersey", "Corridors", "NJDEP", "biota", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2018-12-18T17:52:21.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:41.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5605,38.9268,-73.8993,41.3554", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

That is true despite the fact that much of its diverse landscape has been greatly altered by human enterprises such as agriculture and development that fragments and degrades wildlife habitat. Sustaining wildlife populations over time requires large healthy landscapes with broad expanses of natural habitat. Thus, the Landscape Project focuses on ecoregions or Landscape Regions where plant and animal communities are ecologically similar and closely interlinked. The delineation of the state into regions serves as a spatial framework for management and conservation of species and their habitats, and as a means to organize information so that it is meaningful and widely accessible to end-users. Geographic features and landforms (e.g., rivers, watershed boundaries, ridgelines, soils, vegetation, etc.) were used to delineate the general area of five Landscape Regions in New Jersey. Region boundaries were shifted to align with major roads (county level or larger) that serve as barriers to movement for many species. A sixth region, the Marine Region, is an exclusively aquatic region that includes the New Jersey portion of the Delaware and Raritan bays as well as the portion of the Atlantic Ocean along the coast of New Jersey. ENSP has identified and mapped habitat for endangered, threatened and special concern wildlife within each Landscape Region utilizing an extensive database that combines species occurrence information with land-use/land-cover classification data and species habitat requirements. The resulting Landscape maps provide an accurate, reliable and scientifically sound basis for habitat protection within each region. One of the Landscape Project\"s unique features is that it enables users to focus on the big picture, and not just on individual locations of imperiled and special concern species as those areas become threatened. Thus, within large landscapes, the Landscape Project identifies areas of endangered and threatened wildlife habitat that are important to the maintenance and recovery of New Jersey's endangered and threatened wildlife populations.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Natural Resources", "Conservation", "Ecology", "Water", "Marine", "Environment", "Ecosystem", "Exposure", "public", "biota", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Landscape", "NJDEP", "Envr_hab_ls_v3_3_regions"], "issued": "2018-11-26T19:42:56.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:38.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP)."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.6491,38.7918,-73.8818,41.3585", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.

At the same time, wildlife moves, as individual animals use various habitat features within the landscape to fulfill their foraging, sheltering and breeding needs. Therefore, protecting individual occurrences or the area used by one individual is generally not sufficient to protect the local population. Landscape Project maps address these issues by displaying habitat patches that animals use and that are required to support local populations, rather than pinpointing exact locations of the most sensitive wildlife sites or simply protecting points where species happened to be observed at one point in time.
