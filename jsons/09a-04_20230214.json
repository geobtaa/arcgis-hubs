Based on all available NCRDS data and data provided by Phil Ames from the Peabody Coal Company as of April 2014, a new map of  Hymera Coal Member extent was created. It is the most current extent map of the Hymera Coal Member.

The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant\nexisted or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts\nis to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.\n4-24\nCensus tracts generally have a population size of 1,200 to 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000\npeople. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Ideally,\ncensus tract boundaries remain stable over time to facilitate statistical comparisons from census to\ncensus. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development,\nand so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, significant changes in population may result in\nsplitting or combining census tracts.\nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.</div>", "keyword": ["DNR", "NHD", "Water", "stream", "river"], "issued": "2022-05-16T14:00:28.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-28T15:12:17.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "IndianaMap"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndianaMap"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-180.0000,-90.0000,180.0000,90.0000", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::nhdstatus"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://gisdata.in.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted/NHD_View/FeatureServer/16"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::nhdstatus.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::nhdstatus.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e5e06cf59f38456286cdfca78d4b953f&sublayer=1", "landingPage": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::point-event", "title": "Point Event", "description": "<span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>National Hydrologic Dataset downloaded from\u00a0</span><a target='_blank'>USGS</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>\u00a0\u00a0on 2/4/2022.\u00a0</span><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>This data is also available from the USGS as a service at\u00a0<a href='https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer' rel='nofollow ugc' style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:15px;' target='_blank'>https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer</a></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'><br /></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.

This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies.

(Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.</div>", "keyword": ["DNR", "NHD", "Water", "stream", "river"], "issued": "2022-05-16T14:00:28.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-28T15:12:17.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "IndianaMap"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndianaMap"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-88.2933,37.7465,-83.5906,45.1444", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::point"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://gisdata.in.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted/NHD_View/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::point.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::point.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::point.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::point.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e5e06cf59f38456286cdfca78d4b953f&sublayer=3", "landingPage": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::line", "title": "Line", "description": "<span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>National Hydrologic Dataset downloaded from\u00a0</span><a target='_blank'>USGS</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>\u00a0\u00a0on 2/4/2022.\u00a0</span><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>This data is also available from the USGS as a service at\u00a0<a href='https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer' rel='nofollow ugc' style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:15px;' target='_blank'>https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer</a></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'><br /></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.

(Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.</div>", "keyword": ["DNR", "NHD", "Water", "stream", "river"], "issued": "2022-05-16T14:00:28.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-28T15:12:17.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "IndianaMap"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndianaMap"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-180.0000,-90.0000,180.0000,90.0000", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::nhdfcode"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://gisdata.in.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted/NHD_View/FeatureServer/10"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::nhdfcode.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/INMap::nhdfcode.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e5e06cf59f38456286cdfca78d4b953f&sublayer=12", "landingPage": "https://www.indianamap.org/maps/INMap::nhdflowlinevaa", "title": "NHDFlowlineVAA", "description": "<span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>National Hydrologic Dataset downloaded from\u00a0</span><a target='_blank'>USGS</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>\u00a0\u00a0on 2/4/2022.\u00a0</span><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>This data is also available from the USGS as a service at\u00a0<a href='https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer' rel='nofollow ugc' style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:15px;' target='_blank'>https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer</a></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'><br /></div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.

The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer. Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight. Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs.

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.</div>", "keyword": ["DNR", "NHD", "Water", "stream", "river"], "issued":

The purpose of this dataset was to include those wells with UTM coordinates and to approximate the UTM coordinates for the others based on the most precise of county, or Township, Range, Section, quarter sections (TRS) locations available from office locating, which is effectively the centroid of the smallest known section or quarter sections; thus, increasing the amount of data available for display and analysis in a GIS format. This dataset is combination of the located water well records and the water well records for which an estimated location was able to be determined using the methods described below. This leaves less than 15,000 records with no UTM's associated with them.

Hardcopies utilizing these data shall clearly indicate their source. User agrees not to misrepresent these data, nor to imply that changes made were approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.  The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily for regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource planning, management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs.  When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis.  Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the soil map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components.  The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). The approximate minimum area delineated for Alaska is 2,500 hectares (6,176 acres), which is represented on a 1:5000,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch).Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation.  Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.  Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis.  The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are periodically updated.

The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["geoscientificInformation", "farming", "environment", "Soil Survey", "GDG", "soils", "gSSURGO", "Geospatial Data Gateway", "SSURGO", "Indiana", "IN141 (2021-09-09)", "IN039 (2021-09-07)", "IN091 (2021-09-08)", "IN151 (2021-09-09)", "IN087 (2021-09-08)", "IN089 (2021-09-08)", "IN127 (2021-09-09)", "IN033 (2021-09-07)", "IN113 (2021-09-09)", "IN099 (2021-09-08)", "IN085 (2021-09-08)", "IN149 (2021-09-09)", "IN183 (2021-09-03)", "IN073 (2021-09-08)", "IN003 (2021-09-09)", "IN111 (2021-09-09)", "IN049 (2021-09-07)", "IN131 (2021-09-09)", "IN169 (2021-09-09)", "IN069 (2021-09-07)", "IN103 (2021-09-08)", "IN001 (2021-09-03)", "IN179 (2021-09-09)", "IN181 (2021-09-09)", "IN017 (2021-09-03)", "IN015 (2021-09-03)", "IN007 (2021-09-03)", "IN053 (2021-09-07)", "IN075 (2021-09-08)", "IN009 (2021-09-03)", "IN067 (2021-09-07)", "IN157 (2021-09-09)", "IN171 (2021-09-09)", "IN023 (2021-09-03)", "IN159 (2021-09-09)", "IN095 (2021-09-08)", "IN035 (2021-09-07)", "IN045 (2021-09-07)", "IN135 (2021-09-09)", "IN057 (2021-09-09)", "IN107 (2021-09-09)", "IN011 (2021-09-03)", "IN165 (2021-09-09)", "IN065 (2021-09-07)", "IN177 (2021-09-09)", "IN121 (2021-09-09)", "IN059 (2021-09-07)", "IN097 (2021-09-08)", "IN063 (2021-09-07)", "IN133 (2021-09-09)", "IN041 (2021-09-07)", "IN139 (2021-09-09)", "IN161 (2021-09-09)", "IN145 (2021-09-09)", "IN081 (2021-09-08)", "IN109 (2021-09-09)", "IN167 (2021-09-09)", "IN021 (2021-09-03)", "IN047 (2021-09-07)", "IN119 (2021-09-09)", "IN031 (2021-09-07)", "IN105 (2021-09-08)", "IN005 (2021-09-03)", "IN013 (2021-09-03)", "IN137 (2021-09-09)", "IN029 (2021-09-07)", "IN153 (2021-09-09)", "IN079 (2021-09-08)", "IN055 (2021-09-07)", "IN071 (2021-09-08)", "IN115 (2021-09-09)", "IN093 (2021-09-08)", "IN155 (2021-09-09)", "IN077 (2021-09-08)", "IN083 (2021-09-08)", "IN101 (2021-09-08)", "IN027 (2021-09-07)", "IN143 (2021-09-09)", "IN175 (2021-09-09)", "IN117 (2021-09-09)", "IN019 (2021-09-03)", "IN125 (2021-09-09)", "IN051 (2021-09-07)", "IN037 (2021-09-07)", "IN025 (2021-09-03)", "IN061 (2021-09-07)", "IN043 (2021-09-07)", "IN123 (2021-09-09)", "IN173 (2021-09-09)", "IN129 (2021-09-09)", "IN147 (2021-09-09)", "IN163 (2021-09-09)", "United States of America", "USA"], "issued": "2022-05-09T15:10:42.000Z", "modified": "2023-01-11T15:12:19.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "IndianaMap"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndianaMap"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-88.0975,37.7716,-84.7842,41.7607", "license": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.This dataset is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or siting decisions, but may be used as a reference source.

Based on all available NCRDS data and data provided by Phil  Ames from the Peabody Coal Company as of August 2014, a new map of Colchester Coal Member extent was created.

This shapefile represents  the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials  throughout Indiana.    The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground  shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave  velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their  performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil  class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.    Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):    A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08.  Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.    B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.    C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters  per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.    D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360  meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.    E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20,  moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification  factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.    F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick  and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification  factor is not applicable.    The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:    \"The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic  materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft  sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole  methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles  from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh  County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the  potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the  response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana  or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS,  developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess  damage scenarios.    \"Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic  materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a  substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the  results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map.\"</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["geoscientificInformation", "Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)", "Geology", "Surficial Geology", "Quaternary", "Stratigraphy", "Earthquake", "Ground shaking", "Seismic", "Soil classification", "Shear-wave velocity", "National Earthquake Hazard Reductions Program (NEHRP)", "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)", "Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS)", "Indiana", "Adams County", "Allen County", "Bartholomew County", "Benton County", "Blackford County", "Boone County", "Brown County", "Carroll County", "Cass County", "Clark County", "Clay County", "Clinton County", "Crawford County", "Daviess County", "Dearborn County", "Decatur County", "Dekalb County", "Delaware County", "Dubois County", "Elkhart County", "Fayette County", "Floyd County", "Fountain County", "Franklin County", "Fulton County", "Gibson County", "Grant County", "Greene County", "Hamilton County", "Hancock County", "Harrison County", "Hendricks County", "Henry County", "Howard County", "Huntington County", "Jackson County", "Jasper County", "Jay County", "Jefferson County", "Jennings County", "Johnson County", "Knox County", "Kosciusko County", "Lagrange County", "Lake County", "LaPorte County", "Lawrence County", "Madison County", "Marion County", "Marshall County", "Martin County", "Miami County", "Monroe County", "Montgomery County", "Morgan County", "Newton County", "Noble County", "Ohio County", "Orange County", "Owen County", "Parke County", "Perry County", "Pike County", "Porter County", "Posey County", "Pulaski County", "Putnam County", "Randolph County", "Ripley County", "Rush County", "Scott County", "Shelby County", "Spencer County", "Starke County", "Steuben County", "St Joseph County", "Sullivan County", "Switzerland County", "Tippecanoe County", "Tipton County", "Union County", "Vanderburgh County", "Vermillion County", "Vigo County", "Wabash County", "Warren County", "Warrick County", "Washington County", "Wayne County", "Wells County", "White County", "Whitley County"], "issued": "2022-08-22T18:51:00.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-28T15:12:36.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Indiana Geological Survey"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndianaMap"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-88.0979,37.7717,-84.7846,41.7614", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>DATA DISCLAIMER    This data set was compiled by Indiana University, Indiana Geological  Survey, using data believed to be accurate; however, a degree of error  is inherent in all data.

(It presents the source data used to create a grid named \"CLAY_ILITH_IN\"  in a shapefile format.) The data were obtained from the iLITH Database of the Indiana Geological Survey.  The following explanation of the iLITH Database appears in Open-File Study 00-8 of the Indiana Geological  Survey:    \"iLITH is a Microsoft Access database containing GIS capabilities that allows users to interact with  a portion of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Water-Well Record Database. iLITH  differs from the IDNR database in that lithologic descriptions and drilling contractor names have  been standardized, locational information for ~104,000 water-well logs has been verified, and the  spatial information in the database has been standardized for use with USGS digital elevation data  and US Census Bureau Tiger data.
