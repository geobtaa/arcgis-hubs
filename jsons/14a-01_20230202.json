To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population.

New Jersey has approximately 1,000 miles of rail freight lines serving customers large and small. Our state is served by short line regional and national railroads. Rail shipments allow cost effective movement of goods with less stress on the State's highway system as well as fewer emissions and less energy use.\n\nNJDOT supports New Jersey's economic activity by providing a strong, multimodal transportation system that makes rail service available, safe and effective for as many businesses as possible.\n", "keyword": ["NJDOT RailRoad Network"], "issued": "2018-03-23T12:52:09.000Z", "modified": "2019-01-31T14:43:56.820Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Transportation"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "magdy1412", "hasEmail": "mailto:DOT.GIS@dot.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.4956,38.9314,-73.9373,41.4873", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/NJDOT::railroads-network"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/HggmsDF7UJsNN1FK/arcgis/rest/services/Railroads_Network/FeatureServer/1"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDOT::railroads-network.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3424%2C%22wkid%22%3A102711%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDOT::railroads-network.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3424%2C%22wkid%22%3A102711%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDOT::railroads-network.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3424%2C%22wkid%22%3A102711%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDOT::railroads-network.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3424%2C%22wkid%22%3A102711%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3993bdfed6fd4ec380ce75b40fb14da9&sublayer=6", "landingPage": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/sussex::county-government-facility", "title": "County Government Facility", "description": "This map is used to author a map service for the My Government Services application.", "keyword": ["Government Services;

The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population >= 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters contain a population of 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are >= 50,000. FHWA, however, has slightly different criteria for what defines an urban area. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is >= 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas >= 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (\"smoothed\") to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update underwent a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was provided for each comment.In 2017, minor revisions were made to the urban area based upon comments from FHWA. These revisions were limited in scope and consisted of the following: 1) Adjusted boundary breaks within the urban area so that each Census urban area was only within one NJDOT urban area. 2) Delineated the Poughkeepsie--Newburgh, Mystic Island, and Newton urban areas within the NJDOT urban area. 3) Removed the Belvidere, Milford, and Maurice River urban areas. 4) Merged Upper Greenwood Lake urban area with Poughkeepsie urban area; merged Laurel Lake urban area with Vineland urban area; and merged Woodstown urban area with Philadelphia urban area. 5) Added small portions of the Census urban area (previously omitted from the NJDOT urban area due to smoothing), to the NJDOT urban area to ensure all Census urban areas with a population > 5,000 within the official NJ state boundary were included.", "keyword": ["NJDOT", "  New Jersey urban area", "  FHWA"], "issued": "2017-12-07T17:38:23.000Z", "modified": "2021-02-25T20:17:41.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Transportation"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDOTGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:DOT.GIS@dot.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5361,38.9247,-73.9001,41.2506", "license": "", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/NJDOT::urban-areas"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/HggmsDF7UJsNN1FK/arcgis/rest/services/Urban_Areas/FeatureServer"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e7c0fd65b3dd4c11942fd3709739c495", "landingPage": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/sussex::taxparcel", "title": "TaxParcel", "description": "Sussex County parcels with ownership information.

In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region.

Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.</span></p><p><span>Census tables used to gather data from the 2016 - 2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.</span></p><p><span>For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:http://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/</span></p><p><span>Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs.

Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Census tables used to gather data from the 2015 - 2019 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:http://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

The Plan has two primary documents:</SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 7 0;\"><SPAN>(1) The Connections 2050 Policy Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21027) identifies the vision, goals, strategies, and a summary of the financial plan.</SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 7 0;\"><SPAN>(2) The Connections 2050 Process and Analysis Manual (www.dvrpc.org/Products/21028) provides a more detailed look at the Plan\u2019s outreach, background information, analysis, and financial plan.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>Greater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse cities, boroughs, and townships. The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes each of the region\u2019s municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and defining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester Township (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that are fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres and forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of a Growing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the planning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that will be most beneficial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas and Centers map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actual approaches should always be guided by local conditions.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>The region\u2019s four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing a network of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalize the region\u2019s cities.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most of their population and employment growth, and include inner ring communities adjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and mature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving, offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however, are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating infrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limited incomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with rising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure systems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development can help to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming decline.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number of developable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant population and/or employment growth. Key planning policies in these communities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reduce congestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, and include growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growth techniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such as clustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer of development rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of design and architectural character of the built environment, open space preservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space and recreation are all priorities in these communities.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>Rural Areas include the region\u2019s agricultural communities and communities with large remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches for these communities focus on preservation and limiting development, and include limited expansion of infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle and village character, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resource protection. Livable communities in these areas include rural centers that have an identi fi able main street, a mix of uses, higher densities than their surrounding uses, and a true sense of place. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN /></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["DVRPC", "2050", "long-range plan", "planning", "planning areas"], "issued": "2022-03-08T19:01:04.000Z", "modified": "2022-12-15T18:47:22.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "DVRPC-GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPCGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:slawrence@dvrpc.org"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-76.1331,39.5094,-74.3815,40.6071", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This data is made available for planning purposes only by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) as a public service and is provided AS IS for you to use at your own risk.

They typically will possess exceptional ability to illustrate the natural or cultural heritage of the Highlands Region. They offer excellent opportunities for education or scientific research because they retain a high degree of ecological integrity as well as a relatively unspoiled example of a natural community type. A Significant Natural Area may include publicly held lands whose long term stewardship needs to be carefully tailored to ensure that their values are maintained and preserved, or other lands whose value may be compromised through inappropriate or incompatible land use practices and whose acquisition and management should be prioritized. To assist in the identification of those areas deemed ecologically significant, the Highlands Council employed the use of the New Jersey Natural Heritage Program\u2019s (NHP) Priority Sites data. Using their Natural Heritage Database, the NHP developed the Natural Heritage Priority Sites for Rare Plants and Ecological Communities of the Highlands. The NHP has identified 95 significant natural areas using data collected over the more than 20 year history of the program.

The Known Contaminated Sites List (KCSNJ) for New Jersey are those sites and properties within the state where contamination of soil or ground water has been confirmed at levels equal to or greater than applicable standards. This list of Known Contaminated Sites may include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated or has been completed and addressed via an Institutional Control. The KCSLNJ layer has now been modified such that the information portrayed in the GIS layer is updated on a daily basis through a SQL query of NJEMS/Masterfile. Generating the KCSL GIS layer on a daily basis via an SQL query allows for a dynamic KCSL layer. This is critical for the general public and SRP regulated community by allowing them to see the most up to date information for a known contaminated site in a GIS format via NJ Geoweb. A \"live\" KSCNJ report can also be viewed via Data Miner at: 1) Go to https://www13.state.nj.us/DataMiner 2) Select Search by Category 3) Select Site Remediation then Submit 4) Under General, select The Known and Suspected Sites by County for a listing of Known Contaminated Sites by County. Information concerning individual contaminated sites can be viewed via other dataminer reports based on the Site ID or the SRP Preferred Interest # for the SRP case associated with that site. A small number of sites in the KCSL have no X/Y coordinates as of this date and therefore are not included in the GIS version. Also excluded from the KCSL GIS layer are linear construction projects (due to the inability to properly represent the location of these projects with a single coordinate) and sites without confirmed contamination. Both linear construction projects and sites lacking locational coordinates do appear in the tabular dataminer reports. Coordinates for the GIS version of the KSCL were largely \"front door\" locations acquired via \"address matching\" which is an approximation of the facility front door. Many of these locations were also gathered by the Department using GPS equipment and although these tend to be much more accurate, mistakes are sometimes made. Current protocol for assigning site locations defer to the center of the site or center of facility for the coordinates representing the site location. Since errors can occur, users are encouraged to notify the NJDEP/Site Remediation Waste Management Program/Bureau of Information Systems of any inaccuracies in the KCSNJ through email to srpgis@dep.nj.gov.

The Division, under authority of the Fish and Game Council designates these boundaries. Deer Management Zone boundaries are comprised of major and minor roads, waterways and geographic formations. Included for references are the county and township data. DMZs are updated on an as needed basis. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has identified over 160 sites that are contaminated with chromite ore processing residue, also known as chromate waste. The chromate chemical production waste has been found at residential, commercial and industrial locations. The more than two million tons of waste disposed of over the area were generated by three chromite ore-processing plants which operated for approximately 70 years between 1905 and 1971. The three plants, located in Hudson County, were owned and operated by:PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) at its former chromium chemical production facility location at Garfield Avenue in Jersey City. The predecessors and subsidiaries of AlliedSignal, Inc. (Allied) previously located on Route 440 in Jersey City The predecessor and subsidiaries of Occidental Chemical Corp., Maxus Energy Corp. and Chemical Land Holding, Inc. previously located on the Belleville Turnpike in KearnyPPG, Allied and Occidental are collectively referred to as the Responsible Entities (REs).The chromate waste from the above facilities was used as fill in preparation for building foundations, construction of tank berms, roadway construction, filling of wetlands, sewerline construction and other construction and development projects. Chromate contamination has been found in a variety of places including the walls and floors of buildings, interior and exterior building surfaces, surfaces of driveways and parking lots and in the surface and subsurface of unpaved areas.Included in this GIS layer are those sites within Hudson and Essex Counties in New Jersey where chromate contamination of soil and/or ground water associated with chrome chemical production waste has been identified. This list of chromate waste sites include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated, has been completed or that were originally deemed a chrome site but further investigation determined that chromate contamination was not present. Additionally, more chromate waste sites may yet be identified and accordingly are not included here. For further information contact NJDEP's Site Remediation Waste Management Program (SRWMP) lead program or the Licensed Site Remediation Professional (LSRP), based on the information provided in the Program attribute field. Contact information for SRWMPs lead program, where applicable, can be acquired at www.nj.gov/dep/srp/about/. Additional information regarding chrome site cleanups can be obtained through https://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/siteinfo/chrome/bkgrnd.htm.The Site Status attribute field will serve to identify the specific category associated with each chrome site. Specific attributes by which the layer is symbolized include the following:Active: Site is an active chrome cleanup case being remediated by one or more of the 3 REs Multi Contaminant: Site is an active chrome cleanup case that is being remediated by the responsible entity that owns the property on which the chromate waste contamination has been identified in conjunction with cleanup efforts for contamination associated with their operations or has agreed to address the chromium contamination present at their property.Post Remedial Monitoring: The chromate waste case has been closed with the issuance of a No Further Action (NFA) or Remedial Action Outcome (RAO) letter with soil and/or groundwater contamination addressed via an Institutional Control (Classification Exception Area for ground water and Deed Notice/Engineering Control for soil). Closed - Unrestricted Use: The chromate waste case has been closed with the issuance of a No Further Action (NFA) or Remedial Action Outcome (RAO) letter with no Institutional Controls required.Not a Chrome Site: Properties that were originally listed as chrome sites based on visual observation/past recollection but later found not to have chromate waste contamination present above standard following sampling.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["soil contamination", "hazardous waste sites", "contamination", "Hexavalent Chrome", "Chromate", "New Jersey", "chromate", "environment", "2018", "pollution", "toxic waste sites", "chromium", "chrome +6", "chromesite", "Hudson County", "hexa-valent chrome", "chrome", "Envr_mon_soil_chromesite_area", "NJDEP", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2019-02-21T19:31:38.000Z", "modified": "2022-03-30T14:05:02.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-74.1582,40.6445,-74.0133,40.7806", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Landfills are well-suited for the development of large solar generation projects. Large-scale solar development can offset the costs to cap or remediate these sites and should be encouraged. Other innovative, large-scale solar installations are on the horizon and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, smaller-scale, grid-connected applications. This layer contains available New Jersey statewide parcels or parcel groups greater than 35 acres in size selected by their affiliation with solid waste landfill sites. This data will provide basic information regarding property location and ID for parcels, or groups of parcels based upon the above critieria. Important information concerning parcel data in New Jersey: The feature class retains the selected attributes from the updated statewide Municipality boundary data and selected attributes from MODIV tabular information received from the counties. This combined layer gives users the ability to have not only basic block and lot data from the parcels, but county and municipality identifiers from the Municipality layer and block/lot ownership data from the MODIV. Please note that attempts will be made to keep the data current, but users should be made aware that more updated information may reside directly with the counties. Any question as to the currentness of the data should be confirmed with the associated county entity. The statewide composite of parcels (cadastral) data for New Jersey was developed during a Parcels Normalization Project in 2009 by the New Jersey Office of Information Technology, Office of GIS (OGIS). The normalized parcels data are compatible with the New Jersey Department of Treasury Property Assessment Management System (PAMS) in development, and the MOD IV system currently used by Tax Assessors. Parcels data in New Jersey currently exist countywide for 19 of 21 counties, and for 8 additional municipalities. This (nearly) statewide composite of parcels data will serve as one of New Jersey's framework GIS data sets. Stewardship and maintenance of the data will continue to be the purview of county and municipal governments, but the statewide composite will be maintained by OGIS. Normalization of the parcels data utilized 2008 statewide municipal boundaries data, provided by OGIS, as the spatial framework within which to align the parcel data. The resulting, normalized parcels data accurately and correctly edgematch at and across municipal boundaries. Improvements to the municipal boundaries data were made during this process. New municipal, county and state boundaries data sets will be released by OGIS once all parcels data have been normalized. Parcel attributes were normalized to a standard structure, specified in the New Jersey GIS Parcel Mapping Standard, to store parcel information and provide a PIN (parcel identification number) field common to the PIN stored in the PAMS database. The standard is available for viewing and download at https://njgin.nj.gov/NJParcelStandards/NJGISParcelMappingStandard.pdf. When complete, 19 countywide and 8 municipal parcel data sets will be available for download from the New Jersey Geographic Information Network (NJGIN) web site download page at https://njgin.state.nj.us/NJ_NJGINExplorer/DataDownloads.jsp. Please note that these parcel data sets are not intended for use as tax maps. They are intended to provide reasonable representations of parcel boundaries for planning and other purposes.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Morris County", "Mercer County", "municipalities", "municipal", "parcels", "Warren County", "Sussex County", "boundaries", "NJDEP", "boundary", "parcel", "New Jersey", "Somerset County", "Util_landfill_sw_parcelgrp", "Atlantic County", "New Jersey", "Cape May County", "municipality", "swl_parcelgrp", "Bergen County", "Util_landfill_sw_parcelgrp", "Passaic County", "Salem County", "Camden County", "Essex County", "block", "county", "Gloucester County", "USA", "njfw_cadastral", "Ocean County", "Hunterdon County", "Burlington County", "Cumberland County", "blocks", "Middlesex County", "Union County", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Monmouth County", "solid waste", "planningCadastre", "Hudson County", "landfill", "lots", "lot", "solid waste landfill", "NJ", "parcel group", "counties"], "issued": "2019-04-01T17:32:58.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:08:19.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP/Solid and Hazardous Waste Program"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5249,39.0145,-73.9877,41.1059", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

CAFRA centers, cores and nodes are those centers, cores and nodes, respectively, that have been adopted by the State Planning Commission and reviewed and accepted by the Department for the purposes of CAFRA. The Department delineated mainland and non-mainland coastal centers, based in part on centers identified in the 1992 State Development and Redevelopment Plan, where the State Planning Commission had not yet designated centers. Delineations were digitized over 1991 orthophotography at a minimum scale of 1:12,000. 1995 orthophotography was used to spot check ground conditions. Certain mainland coastal centers expired on March 15, 2007 in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management rules at N.J.A.C. 7:7E-5B.6. However, the Permit Extension Act extended their expiration until July 1, 2010 subject to certain conditions. As a result, the expiration of the following 12 mainland coastal centers was extended until July 1, 2010: Egg Harbor coastal town, Egg Harbor Township; Town Bank/North Cape May coastal town. Lower Township; Cape May Court House coastal regional center, Del Haven coastal village, Goshen coastal hamlet, Green Creek coastal hamlet, Rio Grande coastal regional center, Swainton coastal hamlet, and Whitesboro/Burleigh coastal village, Middle Township; Barnegat coastal town, Barnegat Township; Toms River coastal regional center, Toms River Township; and Lakewood coastal regional center, Lakewood Township. The mainland coastal centers of West Atlantic City coastal town, Egg Harbor Township and Schellenger's Landing coastal town and Villas coastal village, Lower Township expired on March 15, 2007. These coastal centers are located wholly within environmentally sensitive areas identified under the Act and therefore their expiration was not extended. The official description of the mainland coastal center boundaries is the written description posted on the Department's Permit Extension Act web page https://www.nj.gov/dep/opppc/extension.htm. The description of the non-mainland coastal center boundaries is the written description in Appendix 3 of the Coastal Zone Management rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7E. Boundaries of centers, cores and nodes within the CAFRA area were clipped from the 2001 State Plan Policy Map (cenline2, nodes and cores shape files), as amended through May 18, 2010 and form the boundaries of CAFRA centers, cores and nodes. In 2004, the State Planning Commission adopted rules that set expiration dates for certain State Planning Commission designated centers and cores that were not approved through the plan endorsement process. The expiration dates of these designated centers and cores were modified by operation of law by enactment of the Permit Extension Act of 2008. As a result, certain State Planning Commission designated centers and cores that consisted entirely of environmentally sensitive areas expired in their entirety. Environmentally sensitive portions of other designated centers and cores also expired. In response to the expiration of all or portions of these State Planning Commission designated centers the Department repealed all or portions of the CAFRA centers that correspond to these expired State Planning Commission centers. These areas reverted to the Coastal Planning Area that corresponds to the underlying State Plan Planning Area. The following CAFRA centers were repealed in their entirety: Laurel Lake CAFRA village and Port Norris CAFRA village Commercial Township; and, Delmont CAFRA village, Dorchester-Leesburg CAFRA village, Heislerville CAFRA village and Port Elizabeth Bricksboro CAFRA village, Maurice River Township. Portions of the following CAFRA centers and cores were repealed: Oceanville CAFRA village, Smithville CAFRA town, Smithville CAFRA core, and Wrangleboro CAFRA town, Galloway Township; Wildwood City/North Wildwood City/Wildwood Crest Borough/West Wildwood Borough CAFRA regional center, Wildwood City, North Wildwood City, Wildwood Crest Borough, West Wildwood Borough; Cape May City CAFRA town, Cape May City; Cape May Point CAFRA village, Cape May Point Borough; Bridgeton CAFRA regional center, City of Bridgeton; Cedarville CAFRA village, Lawrence Township; Millville-Vineland CAFRA regional center, Millville City and Vineland City; Mauricetown Station CAFRA hamlet, Maurice River Township; Atlantic Highlands CAFRA town, Atlantic Highlands Borough; Long Branch City CAFRA regional center, Long Branch City; Manasquan Borough CAFRA town, Manasquan Borough; and Red Bank CAFRA Regional Center, Red Bank Borough.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["coast_cafracen", "coastal center", "Cumberland", "Salem", "shore", "Monmouth", "NJDEP", "center", "core", "land management", "coast", "Cape May", "coastal", "Burlington", "Middlesex", "environmental protection", "Land_CAFRA_center_bnd", "New Jersey", "Ocean", "2010", "State Plan", "node", "CAFRA", "oceans", "Atlantic", "CAFRA"], "issued": "2018-12-17T14:17:10.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5576,38.9271,-73.9713,40.4196", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Individual WHPAs were then combined into county and statewide coverages with the Arc/INFO Union command. The WHPAs are currently created using the same coordinate files using a Python-based feature creation script producing an ArcGIS geodatabase feature. The individual features are then combined using ArcGIS merge command. Previous WHPA coverages were updated to features also and combined into a statewide WHPA feature. The WHPA feature is distributed as either an ArcGIS shapefile or a layerpack file. The 2011 and earlier WHPA delineation methods are described in \"Guideline for Delineation of Well Head Protection Areas in New Jersey\" available as a download at http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/whpaguide.pdf. Due to security consideration, the PCWS well features are not available for direct download but may be requested from the NJDEP.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["wells", "public community water supply", "well head protection areas", "New Jersey", "njwhpa", "State of New Jersey", "geology", "time of travel", "protection", "Hydr_water_well_WHPA_pc", "aquifer", "delineation", "environment", "tier", "source water protection areas", "pcws", "ground water", "drinking water", "NJDEP"], "issued": "2018-12-06T14:30:28.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:10.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey Geological and Water Survey"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5715,38.9413,-73.9659,41.3183", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Each numbered grid is a 14.288 square mile projection. DMU's used in conjunction with Deer Management Zones (DMZ) by hunters identifying their location in the DMZ. The DMU is the most smallest and most detailed spatial reference used in deer management, i.e. monitoring disease outbreaks. Please note that initial data generation and creation procedures produced various missing grid numbers (222, 231, 244, 414, 550-559) and some grid order issues. Because of pre-existing use of that data in hunting and for data continuity, these have not been corrected. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere. Deer hunters spend more than 100 million dollars each year as they enjoy approximately 1.5 million recreation-days hunting deer. Money spent in the course of deer hunting benefits a wide variety of New Jersey businesses.

These are defined by the EPA as those aquifers that contribute more than 50 percent of the drinking water to a specific area and the water would be impossible to replace if the aquifer were contaminated. Sole-source aquifers are defined with guidelines set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as authorized in section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water act of 1974. Any federally-funded project in an area that could affect ground-water in a sole-source aquifer must be reviewed by the US EPA. This 'project review area' includes the aquifer's 'recharge zone' and it's 'stream-flow source zone'. The recharge zone is the area through which water recharges the aquifer. The source zone is the upstream area that contributes recharge water to the aquifer. The EPA sometimes modifies the project review areas as published in the Federal Register in order to better protect zone as originally published. Most of New Jersey is covered by the seven SSAs and their project review areas. Descriptions of the SSAs can be found in Entity and Attribute information. This is based on notifications published in the Federal Register. The order of chronological approval is as follows: 1.) Buried Valley SSA 2.) Ridgewood SSA 3.) Rockaway SSA 4.) Highlands SSA 5.) Northwest New Jersey SSA 6.) Coastal Plain SSA 7.) Ramapo SSA The sole source aquifer program is a federal program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water Act. All questions about the program should be addressed to them. EPA's reference for the sole source aquifers in New Jersey is at: https://www.epa.gov/region2/water/aquifer/ This data contains polygons of the sole-source aquifers for New Jersey that are approved as of December 2008. The coverage was built by the N.J. Geological Survey from standard GIS files of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic units, New Jersey state and municipal boundaries, and aquifers.

The Division, under authority of the Fish and Game Council designates these boundaries. Deer Management Zone boundaries are comprised of major and minor roads, waterways and geographic formations. Included for references are the county and township data. DMZs are updated on an as needed basis. New Jersey's deer herd is a major component of the landscape throughout all but the most urbanized areas of the state. Deer affect our forests, farms, gardens, backyards and roadways. From a population reduced to a handful of deer in the early 1900s they rebounded during the 20th Century to a thriving herd today. A healthy deer herd, managed at levels that are compatible with current land use practices and the human population, has great value to the people of the state. Deer are photographed, watched and hunted by many in New Jersey and visitors from elsewhere. Deer hunters spend more than 100 million dollars each year as they enjoy approximately 1.5 million recreation-days hunting deer. Money spent in the course of deer hunting benefits a wide variety of New Jersey businesses.

Parcels were linked with MOD4 records using a Unique ID. Queries were created based on the property classes listed above, which resulted in the base open space layer. For QA purposes, the Open Space .shp file was cross-referenced and verified using the online NJACTB tax database (https://www.njactb.org/) as well as park, wildlife management area, natural lands trust and wildlife refuge maps. Using the same process, facility names were also identified and added to the open space .shp file. Within the 15C classifications, there were several parcel types that were not included in the Open Space layer, including forclosed or tax lien properties, government buildings, offices, garages etc. Within the 15D classification churches were not included; for 15F rescue services (Fire Houses, Ambulance Squads) and disabled veterans were not included.</span></p></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["recreation area", "open space", "Stillwater Township", "20070301", "forests", "NJ", "Highlands Preservation Region", "Frankford Township", "Sussex Borough", "Hamburg Borough", "Franklin Borough", "Sussex County", "wildlife management areas", "trail", "Montague Township", "environment", "Sparta Township", "environmental", "Andover Borough", "green acres", "Highlands Planning Region", "njfw_lulc", "Byram Township", "Hardyston Township", "Branchville Borough", "New Jersey", "Andover Township", "Sandyston Township", "Newton Town", "Hampton Township", "Green Township", "Fredon Township", "Lafayette Township", "Wantage Township", "Vernon Township", "boundaries", "land cover", "Hopatcong Borough", "parks", "Ogdensburg Borough", "Walpack Township", "protected land", "Stanhope Borough"], "issued": "2014-11-05T16:11:25.000Z", "modified": "2020-12-02T16:39:26.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Civil Solutions"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "dkunz", "hasEmail": "mailto:dkunz@sussex.nj.us"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-74.9896,40.8992,-74.3711,41.3508", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>The data provided herein is distributed subject to the following conditions and restrictions.

delineate imperiled and special concern species habitat within New Jersey. Many species occurrence locations cannot be published because they may represent nest sites, roost sites, dens and other sites used by species that are vulnerable to human disturbance and, in some cases, susceptible to illegal collection. At the same time, wildlife moves, as individual animals use various habitat features within the landscape to fulfill their foraging, sheltering and breeding needs. Therefore, protecting individual occurrences or the area used by one individual is generally not sufficient to protect the local population. Landscape Project maps address these issues by displaying habitat patches that animals use and that are required to support local populations, rather than pinpointing exact locations of the most sensitive wildlife sites or simply protecting points where species happened to be observed at one point in time. Prior to combining species occurrence data with LULC data to form the habitat patches that make up the Species-Based Habitat layer, each dataset was generated according to a specific data development process.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Natural Resources", "Conservation", "Ecology", "Water", "Marine", "Environment", "Ecosystem", "Exposure", "public", "biota", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Landscape", "NJDEP", "Envr_hab_ls_v3_3_coastal"], "issued": "2018-11-26T15:12:43.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:07.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP)."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-74.9829,38.9282,-73.9709,40.4827", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.

You can also find a breakdown of housing age by county and municipality. Housing are categorized into four categories \u2013 pre-1950, 1951-1978, post-1978, and unavailable. Prior to the 1950s, lead-based paint was commonly used for both home interiors and exteriors. Exposure in older homes happens when lead-based paint starts to deteriorate, cracking or peeling away from the walls. That decay results in lead-contaminated dust, which may be directly ingested or inhaled, and paint chips, which may be touched or, less commonly, ingested. Living in a house with lead-based paint can result in a chronic accumulation of the heavy metal in the body. Houses built after 1978 are less likely to contain lead-based paints. That year, Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in homes built or rehabilitated with federal funding through the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. By 1992, the act was amended to address lead-contaminated dust and soil in homes, as well as adopt preventive strategies to reduce future lead exposure. These homes face the lowest risk of potential lead exposure. In the 1950s, the paint industry voluntary adopted its own standards to phase out and prohibit the use of lead additives, such that homes built between 1950 and 1978 have only some risk of potential lead exposure.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["Health", "boundary", "county", "Municipality", "township", "city", "New Jersey", "health", "borough", "Parcels", "boundaries", "town", "MOD-IV", "municipal", "Municipalities Lead Exposure Information", "NJDEP", "Envr_mon_lead_exposure", "NJ", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2021-10-25T20:08:01.000Z", "modified": "2021-10-25T20:08:26.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Office of Environmental Public Health and Safety"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5871,38.9246,-73.8992,41.3578", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

All 1986 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields were removed from this update, however, all 1995/97 LU/LC polygons remain in this data set, so change analysis can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., 2002 classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2002 and 1995/97.

What is meant by impervious surface is material such as concrete and asphalt that comprise roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and buildings. As the land use/land cover of each polygon was mapped from 2007 aerial photography, a visual estimate was also made of the amount of impervious surface in each. This estimate was recorded as a percentage of the total polygon area, in 5% increments, which are depicted here. These percentages can be used to determine the total acreage of impervious surface in any area of interest. The 2007 LU/LC data set is the fourth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002 and 2007. This present 2007 update was created by comparing the 2002 LU/LC layer from NJ DEP's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database to 2007 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2007 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2002 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2002-2007 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre.

What is meant by impervious surface is material such as concrete and asphalt that comprise roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and buildings. As the land use/land cover of each polygon was mapped from 2012 aerial photography, a visual estimate was also made of the amount of impervious surface in each. This estimate was recorded as a percentage of the total polygon area, in 5% increments, which are depicted here. These percentages can be used to determine the total acreage of impervious surface in any area of interest. The 2012 LU/LC data set is the fifth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002, 2007 and 2012. This present 2012 update was created by comparing the 2007 LU/LC layer from NJDEP's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database to 2012 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2012 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2007 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2007-2012 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre.

The Arc/INFO LULC coverage has been converted to an ArcView shapefile for distribution. The ITUM land use/land cover was photo interpreted from 1986 color infrared (CIR) 1:58000 aerial photos, and delineated using a modified Anderson et al. 1976, classification system to 1:24000 rectified photo-basemaps. These basemaps complied with National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) as individual quadrangles but were not produced from a sophisticated aero-triangulation photogrammetric solution. Minimum mapping unit = 2.5 acres. The ITUM land use/land cover was integrated with three other sources (soils, USGS floodprone areas, and 1906 Atlas Sheet Geology) based on coincident features. The four data layers have subsequently been split out into four separate themes for distribution and use. Beginning in 1998, the NJDEP does not support the data as a single integrated ITUM theme but rather as four separate themes. Freshwater wetlands delineations were made on 1986 orthophoto quarterquad basemaps (1:12000) by photo interpretation of 1986 CIR photos. The classification system used was a modified Cowardin system (Cowardin, et al., 1979). All freshwater wetland polygons greater than 1 acre in area and all linear freshwater wetland features greater than 10 feet in width were mapped. The 1986 quarterquad basemaps meet NMAS and are orthophotos.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["impervious surface", "land cover", "1997", "Land_lu_1986", "Land_lu_1986", "New Jersey", "change analysis", "NJ", "1986", "wetlands", "NJDEP", "Cowardin", "water quality", "watersheds", "1995", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Anderson", "watershed management areas", "land use", "planningCadastre"], "issued": "2019-07-16T13:34:31.000Z", "modified": "2019-07-16T20:11:54.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Bureau of Geographic Information Systems (BGIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

To improve the performance of the web applications displaying the 2002 land use data, it was necessary to create a new simplified layer that included only the minimum number of polygons and attributes needed to represent the 2002 land use conditions. The 2007 LU/LC data set is the fourth in a series of land use mapping efforts that was begun in 1986. Revisions and additions to the initial baseline layer were done in subsequent years from imagery captured in 1995/97, 2002 and 2007. This present 2007 update was created by comparing the 2002 LU/LC layer from NJ DEP's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database to 2007 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating and coding areas of change. Work for this data set was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS). LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 2007 land use directly to the base data layer. All 2002 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this data set, so change analysis for the period 2002-2007 can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 2007. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre.

Water moves through a network of drainage pathways, both underground and on the surface, and these pathways converge into streams and rivers, which become progressively larger (i.e., higher order) as the water moves downstream and the size of the contributing drainage area increases. The connectivity of the stream system is the primary reason for conducting aquatic assessments at the watershed level. Because water moves downstream, any activity that affects the water quality, quantity, or rate of movement at one location can affect locations downstream. Watersheds are widely accepted as an appropriate geographic unit for managing water resources. The condition of a watershed greatly influences the functions and integrity of its wetlands and streams. Land use disturbances in watersheds can have significant negative impacts on wetland or stream morphology, vegetation, flood abatement, water chemistry, and aquatic biota. Watershed-based planning and zoning begins with the notion that the level of impairment of a watershed (e.g., the percent developed lands versus undeveloped forested lands) largely determines the quality of streams and therefore, the attainability of stream protection goals. This, in turn, strongly influences the nature of the stream protection strategy for a given watershed (i.e., the selection of land use standards, stream corridor management plans, implementation of best management practices, and instituting land acquisition or other protection strategies). The extent of forest, in particular, is an important indicator of watershed condition due to its strong association with water quality and as an indicator of the extent of alteration of a watershed due to past human activity. </span></p><p><span>Peer-reviewed scientific literature was reviewed to identify defensible indicators of watershed condition for the Highlands Region. From the suite of indicators identified in the literature, an interdisciplinary team of scientists at the Highlands Council selected the following to evaluate each of the HUC14s of the Highlands Region including: Percent Developed Lands, Percent Habitat Quality, Percent Total Forest, Percent Core Forest, Proportion of Total Forest. </span></p><p><span>Percent Developed Lands is the percentage of a subwatershed that is developed, with developed defined as lands that have been altered for residential and/or commercial use. Developed lands include areas with impervious cover as well as those with non-impervious cover (e.g., lawns, golf courses). Percent developed land is an indicator of watershed impairment (i.e., in general, the higher the percentage, the lower the watershed quality). A negative relationship between developed land use and aquatic habitat integrity exists. The US Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment study compared aquatic community indicators of selected watersheds to the proportion of urban land use in the watershed. It was found that as natural vegetation communities are replaced by developed land, downstream water quality declines due to combined impacts of point and non-point source pollution and soil erosion. The source of these data is the Land Use Land Cover data set developed by the NJDEP.</span></p><p><span>Habitat Quality represents the percentage of a subwatershed that contains habitat for species of concern including rare, threatened or endangered species. The source of this data is the NJDEP\u2019s Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP) Landscape Project. Habitat quality is used as an indicator of the biological diversity of a watershed (i.e., the more habitat that supports a species of concern, the higher the quality of habitat within a watershed). Given the importance of the Act in protecting rare, threatened, and endangered species they are considered to be excellent indicator of watershed protection needs. Often a rare, threatened and endangered species serve as an indicator species and are the first to show the effects of environmental alteration and degradation because they are often sensitive to biological changes within their habitat.</span></p><p><span>Forest Cover provides a reliable indicator of essential ecosystem functions of surface water filtration and groundwater recharge. Connection between forest and water quality has been acknowledged for more than one hundred years, as is evidenced in the 1899 New Jersey State Geologist\u2019s Report on the forests of New Jersey. Further, as previously noted, forests are an indicator of the extent of alteration of a watershed due to past human activity. Three distinct forest cover metrics were utilized to characterize watershed condition, as briefly described below: Percent Total Forest is the percentage of a subwatershed that is forested, with forested defined as all mature and successional upland and wetland forested communities (excluding old fields).

BBLT is an extension of the Barnegat Bay Ambient Monitoring program which was established as part of the Governor\u2019s Comprehensive Plan that ended in 2013. The purpose of this long-term monitoring network is to monitor on-going quality of the bay and its tributaries. Emphasis is placed on the tributaries that are believed to have the most significant impacts/loading to the bay, as well as diverse land use types. The primary goal of these programs is to assess the nutrient conditions of New Jersey\u2019s coastal waters, evaluate changes in water quality in the Barnegat Bay watershed over time and identify areas undergoing nutrient enrichment. The availability of water quality data provided by this program provides environmental managers and researchers with data to better understand relationships of both anthropogenic and natural ecological impacts on water quality. The data and their assessment results will lead to practical policy and decision making to address coastal water quality problems.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Salinity", "Biogenic Silica", "NJDEP", "Turbidity", "Specific Conductance", "CWQN", "Enterococcus", "Chorophyll a", "Anthropogenic", "Dissolved Oxygen", "Total Nitrogen", "environment", "Assessment", "Fecal coliform", "Ammonia", "Marine", "NJ", "BMWM", "Phosphate", "New Jersey", "Bacteriological", "Alkalinity", "Nutrients", "Total Suspended Solids", "pH", "Envr_mon_water_bblt_station", "Temperature", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Monitoring", "Coastal Water Quality Network"], "issued": "2022-11-23T18:40:50.000Z", "modified": "2023-02-02T09:29:42.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Water Monitoring, Standards and Pesticide Control, Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring (BMWM)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.4880,38.9017,-73.9344,40.4742", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

In addition, cell counts are performed to provide an indication if a potential algal bloom is present. If cell counts or species type indicate a possible bloom, BMWM staff will be strategically deployed to conduct additional sample monitoring to identify the extent of the bloom and whether conditions are improving over time.

The data and their assessment results will lead to practical policy and decision making to address coastal water quality problems.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Salinity", "Biogenic Silica", "NJDEP", "Turbidity", "Specific Conductance", "CWQN", "Enterococcus", "Chorophyll a", "Anthropogenic", "Dissolved Oxygen", "Total Nitrogen", "environment", "Assessment", "Fecal coliform", "Ammonia", "Marine", "NJ", "BMWM", "Phosphate", "New Jersey", "Bacteriological", "Alkalinity", "Nutrients", "Total Suspended Solids", "pH", "Envr_mon_water_bblt_station", "Temperature", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Monitoring", "Coastal Water Quality Network"], "issued": "2022-11-23T18:40:50.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-23T18:44:42.992Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Water Monitoring, Standards and Pesticide Control, Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring (BMWM)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.4880,38.9017,-73.9344,40.4742", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

CKEs are geographically defined areas within which the local ground water resources are known to be compromised because the water quality exceeds drinking water and ground water quality standards for specific contaminants. Historically, a number of the CKEs have also been identified as Well Restriction Areas (WRAs). The regulatory authority for developing CKEs is in N.J.A.C. 7:1J, entitled Processing of Damage Claims Pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act. CKEs are used by NJDEP staff, water purveyors, and local officials to make decisions concerning appropriate treatment and/or replacement of contaminated drinking water supplies. Additional guidance on the mapping of CKEs for potable well Immediate Environmental Concerns (IECs) can be found in Section 4.1.6. and Appendix A of the NJDEP Site Remediation Program IEC Guidance Document. The CKE areas, as shown, are intended to provide information to the public about contaminated ground water areas in the state. Unless precautionary measures are taken to protect potable users, well installation should be avoided. This information is being made available so informed decisions can be made on well location, design, or treatment before wells are proposed, permitted, and installed. The Department is currently engaged in the reassessment and investigation of existing CKEs; however, it is important to note that CKEs are approximations of the actual aerial extent of ground water contamination and the boundaries presented here may change over time as new information is developed and plume migration occurs. At this time, the records of the CKEs in this database application may include a list of the specific ground water contaminants where available. Also, it should be noted that CKE areas might overlap with other CKEs and Classification Exception Areas (CEAs). Revisions and additions will be used to update the CKE database as new information is received and processed. In this application, the CKE is represented as a GIS-based polygon coverage that depicts the spatial extent of known potable well contamination in an area (as determined by NJDEP Site Remediation staff). The CKE polygon will usually follow the property boundary lines of all the contiguous properties with contaminated wells when the wells are within 1,000 feet of each other. However, on properties larger than 3.5 acres the boundary of the CKE may be based on the location of the contaminated well and may not encompass the entire property. Also, in some areas contaminated wells may have been detected in proximity to an established CKE but have not been included within the boundary of the CKE because the well is outside the 1,000 foot radius. For further information contact NJDEPs Site Remediation Waste Management Program (SRWMP), Bureau of Environmental Management and Site Assessment (BEMSA), the lead program for CKE case oversight at (609) 530-2474. Be advised that CKEs have not been created for IECs where public supply wells that have been impacted by ground water contamination and a CKE has not yet been developed for all areas where a domestic potable well IEC exists.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["human and environmental health", "well restriction area", "GWIA", "contaminants", "well restriction", "New Jersey", "cke", "Contamination", "Envr_mon_gw_CKE", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "aquifers", "environment", "environment", "oil spill", "unknown source", "gwia", "polygon", "wra", "plume", "WRA", "Groundwater", "NJDEP", "pollution", "IEC", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2016-08-18T14:00:51.000Z", "modified": "2023-02-01T16:30:45.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Site Remediation Program (SRP), Bureau of Information Systems (BIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.3122,39.0223,-73.9262,41.3135", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA TO BE PROVIDED: The following digital spatial data are related to the mapping of the New Jersey Farmland Preservation Program (NJFPP) as they exist as of the specified date: Permanently Preserved easement boundaries, Term Farmland Preservation Program (formerly Eight Year Program) easement boundaries, Independent Purchase easement boundaries and Transfer Development Rights (TDR's) easements. The SADC makes no representations of any kind, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability of fitness for a particular kind, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability of fitness for a particular use, nor are any such warranties to be implied, with respect to the digital data furnished hereunder. The SADC assumes no responsibility to maintain the data in any manner or form II. GUIDELINES: 1. Digital data received from the SADC are to be solely for internal purposes by employees, agents and independent contractors for any purposes normally performed in the conduct of daily affairs. 2. The user is responsible for understanding the accuracy limitations of the above listed digital data layers, as documented in the accompanying metadata documentation, and will use the information accordingly. Any reproduction or manipulation of the above data must ensure that the coordinate reference system remains intact. 3. Any maps, publications, reports, or other documents produced as a result of any project which utilizes SADC digital data will credit the SADC's Geographic Information System as the source of the data with the following credit/disclaimer: \"This (map/publication/report) was developed, in part, using the State Agriculture Development Committee's (SADC's) Geographic Information System digital data but this secondary product has not been verified by the SADC and is not SADC authorized.\" 4. The digital data provided under this Spatial Data Distribution Protocol are meant to be used solely for internal research applications and will not be reproduced or redistributed for use by anyone without first obtaining written permission from the SADC. This clause is not intended to restrict the distribution of printed mapped information produced from the digital data. A request for distribution authorization must be obtained from the SADC prior to distributing digital data to an agent or independent contractor . Any agent or independent contractor, hired to undertake work which will utilize digital data obtained from the SADC, must agree formally in writing, not to use, reproduce, or redistribute SADC GIS data for any purpose other than the specified contractual work. A copy of this written agreement will be submitted to the SADC one week prior to its execution. 5. The Permanently Preserved easement boundaries, Term Farmland Preservation Program (formerly Eight Year) easement boundaries , Independent Purchase easement boundaries and Transfer Development Rights (TDR's) easements, are part of the SADC's Farmland Preservation Program and are produced and released by the SADC. 6. Due to the nature of the Farmland Preservation Program and the closing process, questions regarding the Program should not be resolved by using the maps alone. For this reason, any questions relating to the Farmland Preservation Program or the digital spatial data should be directed to the SADC. Users hereby agree to abide by the use and reproduction conditions specified above and agree to hold any agent or independent contractor to the same terms. By using data provided herein, the user acknowledges that the terms and conditions have been read and that the user is bound by these criteria. The spatial features in this dataset have been compiled from numerous sources and/or methods. Various state, county, local, and non-profit agencies contribute to the spatial features. A field named \"MAP_SOURCE\" contains the source material for every polygon in the dataset. Each of the various spatial data sources has a different spatial accuracy and associated limitations. Considering the nature of the various spatial accuracies, much care must be exercised when using the NJFPP dataset at any given scale. Not every spatial feature in this compilation is intended for site specific referencing. Spatial features that are derived from land surveys are the only features that have verifiable site-specific accuracy. All other features have varying levels of spatial accuracy. DISCLAIMER: Any use of this product with respect to accuracy and precision shall be the sole responsibility of the user. The configuration and geo-referenced location of parcel polygons in this data layer are approximate and were developed primarily for planning purposes. The geodetic accuracy and precision of the GIS data contained in this file and map shall not be, nor are intended to be, relied upon in matters requiring delineation and location of true ground horizontal and/or vertical controls as would be obtained by an actual ground survey conducted by a licensed Professional Land Surveyor.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/NJDASADC::preserved-farmland-of-new-jersey"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://services.arcgis.com/gzSkSfQGxyX6dicF/arcgis/rest/services/NJFPP_Preserved_Farms/FeatureServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDASADC::preserved-farmland-of-new-jersey.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDASADC::preserved-farmland-of-new-jersey.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDASADC::preserved-farmland-of-new-jersey.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NJDASADC::preserved-farmland-of-new-jersey.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D"}], "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0577a84f254b4494bc7d78f887e3aef7&sublayer=56", "landingPage": "https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/njdep::archaeological-site-grid-of-new-jersey", "title": "Archaeological Site Grid of New Jersey", "description": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>Archaeological Sites are locations of prehistoric or historic occupation or activity possessing archaeological value.This dataset includes a vector grid of approximately 1/2 mile cells indicating the presence of Archaeological Districts or Sites that: 1.

This particular product was initially developed for the Connecticut River watershed as part of the Connect the Connecticut project (www.connecttheconnecticut.org) \u2014 a collaborative partnership under the auspices of the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NALCC), and subsequently developed for the entire Northeast region as part of the Nature's Network project (www.naturesnetwork.org). The HUC6 terrestrial core-connector network represents a set of terrestrial core areas and the connectors between them (Fig. 1). In combination with the aquatic core areas, they spatially represent the ecological network designed to provide strategic guidance for conserving natural areas, and the fish, wildlife, and other components of biodiversity that they support within the Northeast.Core areas serve as the foundation of the LCD. They reflect decisions by the LCD planning team about the highest priority areas for sustaining the long-term ecological values of the landscape, based on currently available, regional-scale information. In this product the terrestrial core areas represent the following:1) areas of relatively high ecological integrity across all terrestrial and wetland ecosystem types and geophysical settings, emphasizing areas that are relatively intact (i.e., free from human modifications and disturbance) and resilient to environmental changes (e.g., climate change). Integrity has the potential to remain high in these areas, both in the short-term due to connectivity to similar natural environments, and in the long-term due to proximity to diverse landforms and other geophysical settings;2) areas of relatively high current landscape capability for a suite of representative (a.k.a. surrogate species) terrestrial wildlife species, emphasizing areas that provide the best habitat and climate conditions today; and3) areas of rare terrestrial natural communities that support unique biodiversity, regardless of their landscape context; inclusive of communities listed by state heritage programs as S1 (extremely rare), S2 (rare), and S3 (uncommon), with definitions ofS1-S3 varying slightly among states.Core areas were built from focal areas (\u201cseeds\u201d) within each HUC6 watershed that have high value based on one or more of the attributes listed above. These \u201cseeds\u201d were expanded to encompass surrounding areas that provide additional ecological value and resilience to both short- and long-term change. The surrounding areas were typically of high to moderate ecological value. In some cases the final core areas contained low-intensity development and minor roads, but high-intensity development and major roads were excluded. Collectively, the terrestrial core areas identified in this product encompass ~25% of the Northeast, as decided by the LCD planning team, including a total of 20,358 disjunct core areas encompassing a total of 16,160,371 ha and ranging in size from 3.6 to 107,996 ha, with an average size of 794 ha.Connectors represent \u201ccorridors\u201d that could facilitate the movement of plants and animals (i.e., ecological flow) between terrestrial core areas. These connectors increase the resiliency of the core area network to uncertain land use and climate changes. They are wider where more movement between cores is expected because of larger, higher-quality, and closer core areas and where a more favorable natural environment exists between them. Connectors primarily link adjoining core areas along routes that possess the greatest ecological similarity to the ecosystems in the adjoining cores; they do not necessarily represent travel corridors for any individual species. Connectors may traverse through areas of low-density development and cross roads of all classes, but they do not include high-intensity development. Connectors are not identified between core areas that are greater than 10 km apart. Collectively, connectors encompass an additional ~17% of the Northeast.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ", "NJDEP", "environment", "public", "Envr_NERCP_terrestrial_core", "New Jersey", "HUC6", "NJ", "core areas", "New Jersey", "environment", "terrestrial", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-11-22T19:03:35.000Z", "modified": "2022-11-22T19:03:38.755Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Office of Fish and Wildlife Information Systems."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5491,38.9289,-73.8982,41.3529", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

In 2003, the Division of Fish and Wildlife's Bureau of Marine Fisheries, with funding from the Coastal Management Program, updated the map in digital format for inclusion in the Department's Geographic Information System. The updating of the map was accomplished through direct interviews with recreational fishing boat captains. Prime recreational fishing grounds identified in the various publications referenced in the rule and commercially prepared sport fishing charts (Homeport Charts and Charter Boat Charts) were transferred onto two sets of NOAA nautical charts, which served as the working or base map. For fishing grounds within 20 nautical miles of the coast, NOAA nautical charts Series 12326, 12323, 12318 and 12214 at a scale of 1:80,000 were used. For fishing beyond 20 nautical miles NOAA nautical charts Series 12200 and 12300 at a scale of 1:400,000 were used. During the summer of 2003, 28 party boat captains, 47 charter boat captains and 22 private boat captains from each fishing port (inlet) along the Atlantic Coast of New Jersey were interviewed by Department staff. These recreational fishing party boat, charter boat and private boat captains were selected because they fish the ocean waters on a daily basis using a wide variety of methods to catch a variety of fish species. The interview process entailed examining the accuracy of the already delineated prime fishing areas on the base map. Fishermen modified the base map by drawing their changes on the map. In general, modifications to the boundaries of the prime fishing areas resulted in an increase to the size of the prime fishing area. In a similar fashion, the captains drew new prime fishing areas on the base maps. The revised base maps were then digitized into the New Jersey Specific Sport Ocean Fishing Grounds Coverage. In 2018, the NJ Bureau of Marine Fisheries again updated the New Jersey Prime Fishing Grounds to include all current 17 artificial reef sites, and updated Homeport Charts. Under the DEP\u2019s plan to balance access, regulations have set aside a portion of the Sandy Hook Reef and two sections of the Axel Carlson Reef as Full Access Zones. These are areas where persons may use, leave, deploy, or tend lobster conch, fish pot gear.   Recreational hook and line anglers are not prohibited from utilizing the Full Access Zones for fishing. The use of fixed gear is prohibited on all other reef sites as they are all deemed Special Management Zones by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Service as well as Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council. The use of fixed gear on any reef or portion of a reef not explicitly defined is prohibited and punishable by law (N.J.A.C. 7:25-18.5A). The 1nm buffer polygons were incorporated to represent the entire surrounding area where fishing opportunity associated with each point feature may occur.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ Prime Fishing Grounds", "Artificial Reef Sites", "ocean", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Envr_admin_fish_prime_bnd", "Reef Boundaries", "Reef", "Oceans", "Boundaries", "NJDEP", "New Jersey", "NJ"], "issued": "2019-02-01T15:42:14.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-20T15:24:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Marine Fisheries"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.0942,37.2480,-71.2166,41.0792", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The purpose is to create a network of artificial reefs in the ocean waters along the New Jersey coast to provide a hard substrate for fish, shellfish and crustaceans, fishing grounds for anglers, and underwater structures for scuba divers. Within each reef site, which range in size from one-half to over four square miles, numerous deployments or \"patch reefs\" have been constructed. A patch reef is an area within a reef site boundary where material has been deployed. In total, over 4000 patch reefs have been constructed on the state's 17 reef sites since the program began. Reefs are used extensively by anglers and divers who catch summer flounder, winter flounder, ling, black sea bass, tautog, scup, and lobster along with a myriad of other species.Deployments most often consist of three material types; concrete, rock, and metals. These deployments are frequently old bridges, dredge rock, or ships which have all been repurposed as artificial habitat. Over time, these materials become encrusted and a living reef matrix envelopes the structure. This matrix can be several layers thick as different types of encrusters compete for an available toehold, often growing on top of each other. At this stage of reef development, a multitude of minute organisms take up residence in this protective matrix and form an important component of the food chain. Deployed reef structure not only leads to more food for marine fish, but also increases the energy efficiency of reef feeding by dissipating underwater currents. The structure acts as a baffle, reducing current along the bottom, which allows energy from food to be used for growth rather than exertion. Additionally, as water flows over and around reef structure, eddies form, which carry food to waiting fishes.The DGPS coordinates upon which this GIS data is based were obtained through direct observation, i.e. by finding each structure at sea and then recording its exact location from LORAN C and DGPS receivers. Older patch reef coordinates were obtained using LORAN C devices. More recent reef drops were recorded with DGPS machines. To convert the earlier reef deployment coordinates that were obtained solely from LORAN C devices into DPGS, two techniques were used. Most of the conversions were obtained by on-site observations. If an on-site observation was not possible, mathematical equations were used to convert from Loran C into DGPS. Unfortunately, while close, these conversions are usually not accurate enough to find reef structures. The exact locations of structures can usually be found by using a wreck search patterns.This dataset includes all deployments located at reef sites and installed between 1905-2016 as well as deployments installed after 2016 which were sponsored.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["NJ", "NJDEP", "new jersey", "New Jersey", "nj", "Deployment", "Envr_admin_fish_reef_deployment", "wreck", "reef", "artificial reef", "ocean", "oceans", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-06-08T14:15:51.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-20T15:24:27.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Fish and Wildlife (FW), Office of Fish and Wildlife Information Systems"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.0786,38.8393,-73.6815,40.3894", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Specifically, springs are places where subsurface water comes to the surface from the ground and flows or where it lies in pools that are continually replenished from below. Thus, a spring is a site where the aquifer surface meets the ground surface. The water source for a spring can vary. Some springs are fed by shallow groundwater seepage out of the soil, while others are fed by deep aquifer water discharged under artesian pressure. These differences influence the hydrology and the water chemistry of springs. They range in size from intermittent seeps, which flow only after a great deal of rain, to huge spring pools with tens of thousands of gallons flowing daily. Springs may be permanent (perennial) and flow throughout the year, or ephemeral (intermittent or temporary) and flow only during or after rain. Where evaporation is high, the flow of springs can decrease or cease during the warm season. The amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including: the size of the caverns (or porosity) within the rocks, the water pressure in the aquifer, the size of the spring basin, and the amount of rainfall. Human activities can also influence the volume of water that discharges from a spring. Ground-water withdrawals in an area can reduce the pressure in an aquifer, causing water levels in the aquifer system to drop and ultimately decreasing the flow from the spring. In some cases, springs have completely disappeared over time due to water withdrawal from urbanization. It is thought that half of all the springs in the United States have dried up since settlement of the country began. New Jersey has many examples of springs which once flowed but do not exist anymore.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["surficial", "NJDEP", "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection", "New Jersey Geological Survey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Hydr_spring", "New Jersey", "water", "NJGS", "NJGWS", "geology", "State of New Jersey", "geoscientificInformation", "njsprings", "spring"], "issued": "2019-07-15T17:18:15.000Z", "modified": "2022-07-11T15:58:01.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), New Jersey Geological and Water Survey (NJGWS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5030,38.9709,-73.9963,41.3186", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Waters are classified in one of five categories: Prohibited - harvest not allowed under any conditions. Special Restricted - harvest allowed with a special permit requiring further purification of the shellfish before sale. Seasonal (Nov - Apr) - and Seasonal (Jan - Apr) - where harvest is permitted only during certain seasons of the year. The final category is Approved - harvest permitted under any conditions. Classification of the waters is based on the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. As specified in this program, classifications are based on three components: 1) Regular monitoring of water quality 2) Field surveys of shoreline conditions 3) Study of water currents and flows (hydrography). These functions are performed by New Jersey's Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring which monitors about 2,500 locations a minimum of five times a year. Please note: Shellfish water classifications in this theme may be temporarily superseded by an emergency closure order. The Department may suspend harvest in areas impacted by an intermittent pollution episode or emergency condition when the event has or may have a deleterious impact on public health. Public notice will be provided of any emergency closures. However, if there are any questions about the suitability of a shellfish growing are for harvest, please contact the Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring at (609) 748-2000.

Prior to that date, there was no reporting requirement and no mechanism in place to track or record Area in Need of Redevelopment determinations. While outreach was conducted to obtain information on determinations made prior to the statutory amendment, not all municipalities responded, and it is therefore not possible to establish the extent to which the data in this file are comprehensive. An amendment to the LRHL, effective as of September 6, 2013, requires municipalities specify whether or not the use of eminent domain is authorized within an area determined to be in need of redevelopment. Areas where the use of eminent domain powers are authorized are referred to as \u201cCondemnation Redevelopment Areas\u201d and areas where the use of eminent domain powers are not authorized are referred to as \u201cNon-Condemnation Redevelopment Areas.\u201d The attribute field \u201cCONDEMN\u201d was added to capture this distinction.

In order to determine high priority areas in the Highlands Region for preservation, the Council used the results of the Resource Assessment to identify and prioritize those lands within the Highlands Region which have the highest water and ecological resource values. These values are based on a combination of indicators using methodologies discussed elsewhere in the RMP which measure the quantity and quality of regional resources such as: watershed conditions, Highlands Open Waters, Riparian Areas, prime ground water recharge areas, forests, Critical Habitat, and steep slopes. Moreover, existing protected lands, showing the historic pattern of land preservation activities in the Region, will be identified and integrated with the ecological resource value to identify priority areas for conservation. This prioritization process will enable the Council to identify a confidential inventory of open space lands and farmland within the Conservation Priority Area and the Agricultural Priority Area and a Special Environmental Zone in the Preservation Area to respond to Section 12.a of the Highlands Act, which are areas that should not be developed due to their importance for water resource and ecological protection.

Centers are the NJSDRP's preferred vehicle for accommodating growth. A Center's compact form is considerably more efficient than sprawl, providing opportunities for cost savings across a wide range of factors. Compact form also translates into significant land savings. A Center&amp;apos;s development form and structure, designed to accommodate diversity, is also more flexible than single-use, single-purpose sprawl, allowing Centers to evolve and adapt over time, in response to changing conditions and markets. Centers promote community, protect the environment, provide enhanced cultural and aesthetic experiences, and offer residents a superior quality of life.Identified Centers are those that have been approved by the NJ State Planning Commission as places where Designated Centers might be created. Identified Centers are preliminary in nature and would get mapped boundaries if designated. Center locations were determined through a process called &amp;quot;Cross-acceptance,&amp;quot; in coordination with other state, county and local entities. At this point, the Identified Centers have been on the official state plan mapping for over 25 years. It could be argued that they are no longer relevant as 25 years is more than enough time for them to have moved on to designation.

Limited Constrained Slopes: All non-Riparian Area lands having a slope of 15% to less than 20%, which are non-forested, are not highly susceptible to erosion, and do not have a shallow depth to bedrock or a Soil Capability Class indicative of wet or stony soils. Steep slopes within the Highlands Region play an important ecological, recreational, scenic, and functional role. Steep slopes and rocky ridgelines provide specialized habitats that are home to rare plant and animal species. Areas of steep slope provide popular recreational opportunities including hiking, climbing, and wildlife observation. Ridgelines, hillsides, and steep slopes provide scenic views and vistas, which contribute to the rural character of the Highlands Region and help to define the landscape. Disturbance of areas containing steep slopes can trigger erosion and sedimentation, resulting in the loss of topsoil. Silting of wetlands, lakes, ponds, and streams damages and degrades wetland and aquatic habitats, especially trout streams that are found throughout the Highlands and receive the State\u2019s highest water quality protections. Steep slope disturbance can also result in the loss of habitat quality, degradation of surface water quality, silting of wetlands, and alteration of drainage patterns. These processes, when severe, can also result in land slumping and landslides that can damage both developed property and ecosystems. The severity and extent of slopes, soil characteristics, and land cover all affect the potential for damages from the disturbance of steep slopes. The identification and classification of steep slopes is important in order to effectively manage critical natural resources in the Highlands Region.</span></p></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["riparian", "water", "wetlands", "streams", "soils", "flood prone", "New Jersey Highlands"], "issued": "2020-02-19T15:40:23.000Z", "modified": "2021-09-10T18:30:19.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJ Highlands Council"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJHWPPC", "hasEmail": "mailto:gis.mailbox@highlands.nj.gov?subject=ArcGIS Online"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.1988,40.4857,-74.3131,41.3151", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV STYLE=\"font-size:12pt\"><P><SPAN>Data Distribution Agreement The Highlands Council Agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of the following: I.

These data show the location and areas of leases within Atlantic Coastal bays and estuaries and in the Delaware Bay region of New Jersey. These data may change monthly depending on leasing transactions, i.e. Council actions to approved pending leases, leases vacated due to non-payment or lessee action. These data were created to facilitate the leasing program within the Atlantic Coast and Delaware Bay regions of New Jersey.

This data is typically updated monthly due to new and vacated leases. Atlantic Coast Leases are measured in Acres or Linear Feet (length of bank out to 16 ft depth at mean low water). Linear Feet applies to leases in the Mullica River, Motts Creek and tributaries. This measurement was established on May 12, 1917 by the Board of Shell Fisheries. There were a few leases, however, near the mouth of Nacote Creek in the Mullica River that are in acres.Relay Leases - all special hard clam relay leases within Atlantic Coastal bays and estuaries of New Jersey are used exclusively for the planting of hard clams harvested from marginally polluted waters \u201cRestricted\u201d, under the DEP shellfish resource recovery program, for the purpose of utilizing these hard clam resources by cleansing them to health standards for marketing and human consumption as codified under NJAC 7:25-15 and NJAC 7:12-9.

Additionally, no lands under the tidal waters of the Navesink River and Shrewsbury River shall be leased for the planting and cultivating of shellfish. a line that delineates lands in tidal waters of the Mullica River in which no additional leases will be granted. The Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers were created based upon the existing NJDEP 2015 Waterbody GIS data layer. Parker Cove was digitized based upon provided coordinates. Cedar Creek, Forked River, and Sloop Creek were digitized based upon georeferenced photographs of historic charts delineating those areas - as such, the boundaries are approximate only.Great Egg Harbor River Lease Exclusion Area - Title 50:1-23 \u201cShellfish\u201d states that no additional lands shall be leased at the mouth of the Tuckahoe River and the Great Egg Harbor River. This line also defines the boundary of the area described under NJAC 7:25-19, Atlantic Coast Harvest, in which the harvest clams and oysters in the Great Egg Harbor River, Tuckahoe River and Middle River can only be established by the Division, with the advice of the Atlantic Coast Section of the NJ Shellfisheries Council by hand tongs only. Harvest shall not be permitted between June 30 to September 1 of any year. This data shows the delineation of areas above the line established on the \u201cofficial chart\u201d in which no new leases may be granted and clam and oyster harvest is restricted to hand tongs only during a harvest season.Mullica River Title 50 Lease Exclusion Area - Title 50:1-23 \u201cShellfish\u201d describes a line that delineates lands in tidal waters of the Mullica River in which no additional leases will be granted. No new leases shall be granted under the waters of the Mullica River above a line extending in a westerly direction from the south end of Deep Point. Existing leases may be granted \u201cheretofore\u201d in this area of the Mullica. In summary, leases that were previously granted and were subsequently vacated, could be granted again.Cape Horn Lease Exclusion Area - Cape Horn (Great Bay) Lease Exclusion Area defined by the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations is an area where no new lease applications will be accepted as it was classified as productive and new leases discouraged as per (NJAC 7:25-24.6(d)1i. The line defining the area was drawn on a NOAA Nautical Chart 12316 (23rd Ed. November 15, 1986). The chart was defined as the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d and kept with the leasing charts at the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife Nacote Creek Shellfish Office. The citation as adopted September 18, 1989. There are numerous current shellfish leases that were established prior to the adoption of this rule. If one of these Cape Horn leases become vacated, the vacated parcel may not be re-leased. The area was digitzied within GIS using landmarks and navigation aids depicted on the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d. The 1986 version of the chart used for the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d has since been updated.Goosebar Lease Exclusion Area - Regulatory area pertaining to shellfish leases: no leases allowed in area defined as the Goosebar in Little Egg Harbor Bay.Lakes Bay Lease Exclusion Area - Lakes Bay is an area defined by the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations as an area classified as productive in which leasing is discouraged (NJAC 7:25-24.6(d)1iii. The line defining the area was drawn on a NOAA Nautical Chart 12316 (23rd Ed. November 15, 1986). The chart was defined as the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d and kept with the leasing charts at the NJ Bureau of Shellfisheries Nacote Creek Shellfish Office.The citation as adopted September 18, 1989.Sunflower Island Lease Exclusion Area - Sunflower Island, Brigantine is an area defined by the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations as an area classified as productive in which leasing is discouraged (NJAC 7:25-24.6(d)1iv. The line defining the area was drawn on a NOAA Nautical Chart 12316 (23rd Ed. November 15, 1986). The chart was defined as the \u201cOfficial Chart\u201d and kept with the leasing charts at the Nacote Creek Shellfish Office. The citation as adopted September 18, 1989. There are a few current shellfish leases that were established prior to the adoption of this rule.Great Sound Lease Exclusion Area- Policy area pertaining to shellfish leases: expansion of the Great Sound lease block is limited to the area between the eastern boundary line of the existing lease area to the western boundary of the existing lease area.Brigantine and Absecon Lease Restriction Area - The waters between the City of Brigantine and City of Absecon have a history of productive hard clam harvest and other commercial fisheries such as crab potting. The Shellfish Council had made several policy decisions in regard to leasing limiting additional new leases, but maintaining existing leases or eliminating certain leases that may go vacant that were established prior to the Council\u2019s policies. These policy decisions can be found on the \u201cLeasing Policy of the Atlantic Coast Section of the New Jersey Shellfisheries Council.\u201d In addition, waters classified as productive hard clam habitat are discouraged from leasing as per the Leasing of Atlantic Coast Bottom for Aquaculture regulations at NJAC 7:25-24. The area was digitized in GIS based upon the NJDEP's 2015 Landuse/Landcover dataset and using geographic landmarks to delineate waterbodies defined by Council policy and areas considered productive for hard clams.Graveling Beds - Regulatory area pertaining to NJ Atlantic coast shellfish leases: no leases allowed in mapped area.The Graveling Beds are an area defined under Title 50 and the Atlantic Coast Harvest Season regulations NJAC 7:25-19. No leases are allowed in the Graveling beds. There are five main oyster reef lumps in this region known as the Graveling Beds which consist of Fitney Bit, Reef Bed, Oyster Bed Point Bed, Turtle Island Beds and an unnamed lump near Goose Cove. These beds are located within a boundary known as the Graveling Beds. Harvest in the Graveling Beds can only be established by the Division, with the advice of the Atlantic Coast Section of the NJ Shellfisheries Council by hand tongs only. Harvest shall not be permitted between June 30 to September 1 of any year.Kings Grant (Little Egg Harbor Bay) \u2013 Area of the Riparian Grant in Little Egg Harbor Bay which is known as the \u201cKings Grant.\u201d This area is unleasable for shellfish as the grant is exclusive to the grant holder. This data delineates riparian grant issued in 1896. It\u2019s called a Kings Grant, but we believe that is mistaken. The grant gives exclusive rights to the grant holders to the bottom.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["NJ", "Exclusion", "shellfish", "Envr_admin_shellfish_lease_exclusion", "marine", "New Jersey", "oyster", "NJDEP", "fish and wildlife", "environment", "Lease", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2022-04-28T18:46:24.000Z", "modified": "2022-04-28T18:46:45.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Office of Fish and Wildlife Information Systems"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-74.8226,39.0823,-73.9742,40.3974", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

NOTE: This dataset is a first iteration and is in no way complete; instead, this should be viewed as a \u2018living\u2019 dataset. The NJ Trails Taskforce is currently developing a process to maintain, fill in data gaps, and make the dataset more robust over time There is no authoritative central location for the public to access Trail locations online. Many independently owned websites offer this information, but it is often crowd sourced and therefore may not be accurate. If the state hosted and maintained the NJ Statewide Trails GIS data then the general public, landowners, land managers, and first responders would have a reliable place to look for this information. Data can be used for planning new trails, advocating for use, search and rescue, and more. NOTE: Managing agency will still be primary point of contact for the most accurate, up-to-date trail locations and conditions. Users of the data will be able to see where trails are in relation to their area of interest. Users can use trail data to plan hiking trips and create routes. Data can be used on maps to show location of trails when relevant or used in analysis. First responders can use data to find lost hikers. There is also a benefit statewide \u2013 data can be used as a statewide trail planning tool to improve New Jersey\u2019s trail network. For Green Acres and others involved in land preservation, this data will assist in the identification of parcel acquisitions needed to connect larger trail systems, and it will allow the Trails Program to effectively evaluate project proposals. For the Office of Environmental Justice, the environmental justice mapping tool can be used in conjunction with this database to target efforts in overburdened communities where trails or access to trails are limited or nonexistent. For the State Park Service, this data will allow land managers to make trail connections to adjacent properties to improve the trail network, and the data can be used on existing maps to show trails that neighbor park properties. For the New Jersey State Police, Search and Rescue efforts can be aided using this data. For government agencies, non-profits and others, trail data will provide the data necessary to accurately plan for connections or extensions to existing trail networks and/or be used to advocate for the creation of new and/or connecting trail networks.", "keyword": ["NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "NJDEP", "paths", "recreation", "statewide planning", "search and rescue", "county planning", "transportation", "multiuse paths", "trail data", "trails", "municipal planning", "transportation alternatives", "Statewide Outdoor Recreation Plan", "NJ Trails Plan", "planning", "environment", "footpaths", "parks", "recreational trails", "New Jersey", "NJ", "Green Acres", "Land_use_trails_NJ"], "issued": "2022-02-28T17:46:00.000Z", "modified": "2022-03-09T16:05:04.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.2110,38.9287,-73.8996,41.3429", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Displayed are all polygons that have a TYPE02 code of 'WETLANDS'. While these wetland delineations are not regulatory lines, they represent important resource data in identifying potential wetland areas. These wetland data have a somewhat involved delineation history. Non-tidal wetlands were first mapped in a separate effort under the Freshwater Wetlands Mapping Program (FWW), based on 1986 photography. Although the original FWW maps were produced as a separate data set, they were incorporated into a state wide composite land use/land cover (LU/LC) data set also being initially mapped from the 1986 photography. The FWW delineations were integrated into the LU/LC data layer in their entirety as originally delineated, with all line work and coding intact. The tidal wetlands were being mapped as part the LU/LC mapping effort itself. This integrated data set, including the FWW delineations, and the remaining land use/land cover delineations for areas outside of the FWW polygons, which included tidal wetland areas, became the initial 1986 LU/LC layer for the NJDEP. Beginning in 1995, NJDEP acquired new aerial imagery, and began updating the initial integrated LU/LC layer from 1986 based on this newer imagery. The 1986 layer was examined with the new imagery, and areas of change delineated, with any new line work and land use codes needed to map the changes added to the base data set. This updated LU/LC layer is identified as Land Use 1995 in this application. Included in the change analysis were any non-tidal wetland polygons mapped in the original FWW mapping effort, as well as any tidal wetland polygons mapped in the 1986 LU/LC mapping effort. More recently, new photography was acquired in the spring of 2002, and this photography was used in a second land use update project. The Land Use 1995 layer was examined over the 2002 imagery, and an updated layer based on the 2002 imagery was created, available in this application as 'Land Use 2002'. The layer displayed here is the selection of all wetlands, both tidal and non-tidal, as included in that 2002 land use layer. As with all original wetland delineations delineations, this data set is intended to serve as a resource for analysis rather than regulatory delineations. The NJDEP may change the line work of any wetlands polygon based on more in depth analysis and field inspection for regulatory purposes.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["wma", "land use/land cover", "WMA", "Land_lu_2002_wetland", "watersheds", "NJ", "1997", "watershed management areas", "planningCadastre", "Land_lu_2002_wetland", "impervious surface", "wetlands", "njfw_lulc", "NJDEP", "2002", "Cowardin", "1995", "water quality", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "wet02", "New Jersey", "change analysis", "Anderson"], "issued": "2019-04-24T18:27:36.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:59.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Bureau of Geographic Information Systems (BGIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5873,38.9258,-73.9022,41.3568", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

It also comes with an associated database file, projection file and metadata. The shapefile and metadata are compressed as a .zip file for download. This data shows locations of current and historic canals and raceways. Where possible, these have been mapped based on site visits or current aerial photographs. The location of some abandoned and filled canals and raceways are approximated from historic maps and photographs and are not guaranteed to be accurate. Some of the mapped canals and raceways are located on private property with no public access. Other canals and raceways allow public access on the canal itself or neighboring pathways, for recreational purposes. The user of this product is responsible for determining if a canal or raceway is open to the public before visiting. This data does not include dewatering canals and ditches with two exceptions, the Berry's Creek Canal and the Old Canal. They were included in this data because they are navigable. Channelized streams and underground aqueducts are not included in this shapefile. The New Jersey Geological Survey is interested in updating this product.

This version corrects 290 overlapping topology errors which were extremely small and visually undetectable. The 14-digit hydrologic units (HUC14s) in New Jersey is a revision of the 2006 version of these units. This version corrects some boundaries to be consistent with a new hydrography coverage based on 1:2,400 aerial photographs (NJDEP, 2008). It also makes some changes to be more consistent with a new 12-digit hydrologic unit coverage (EPA, 2009). This editing process created 42 new HUC14s, deleted one inland HUC14 and five coastal HUC14s in the Delaware Bay, and changed over 100 boundaries. A report detailing these changes (Hoffman and Pallis, 2009) is available online . For programmatic reasons the 14-digit units are clipped to New Jersey's political boundary. HUC14 hydrologic units were first published by Ellis and Price (1995) and made available as a shape file by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection soon afterword. Watershed boundaries were based on elevations and water courses from 1:24,000-scale (7.5-minute) USGS quadrangles. These were revised (NJDEP, 2006) by clipping the unit boundaries to the official NJ state boundary and addition of some additional identification information. Some boundaries were changed at that time to reflect errors found in the original coverage. This product is an interim product and will be replaced once better elevational data are available. It is based on elevational data from quadrangle maps at a scale of 1:24,000. The hydrography is at 1:2,400. Once high-resolution LiDAR data (at 1:2,400 or better) become available for New Jersey the 14-digit hydrologic units will be redrawn and this interim coverage will be replaced. EPA's 12-digit hydrologic system (USEPA, 2009) uses a numbering convention that is not entirely consistent with the 14-digit numbering system. For some HUC14s, the first 12 digits do not match the identification number of the 12-digit hydrologic unit it lies within. These discrepancies will be corrected when the HUC14s are next revised.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Hydr_HUC14_bnd", "environmental protection", "NJDEP", "drainage basin", "inlandWaters", "HUC14", "hydrology", "State of", "dephuc14", "New Jersey", "hydrologic-unit codes", "hydrologic", "hydrologic units", "subwatershed", "huc14", "watershed", "HUC"], "issued": "2018-12-17T14:25:06.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:13.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJ Dept. of Environmental Protection, (NJDEP), NJ Geological Survey (NJGS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5934,38.8493,-73.8597,41.3576", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

The original 17 map sheets (numbered from 21 through 37) were produced with grid lines shown every 2 minutes of latitude and every 2 minutes of longitude, producing a regular grid of RECTANGLES. This rectangular grid forms the basis of the reference system. For each sheet, groups of RECTANGLES are aggregated together to form BLOCKS . Each BLOCK in each sheet is given a number from 1 to 45. Within each BLOCK, each RECTANGLE is numbered from 1 to 9. RECTANGLES are further divided into 9 sections called UNITS (numbered 1 to 9) and each UNIT divided into 9 sections called PARTS (also numbered 1 to 9). Each of these smallest sub divisions can be identified by a unique 7 digit code composed of the ATLAS SHEET number, and the number of the BLOCK, RECTANGLE, UNIT and PART. This 7 digit identifier is part of the historical well database and is still used on new permits.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["imageryBaseMapsEarthCover", "New Jersey Rectangular Coordinate System", "grid", "sheet", "Grid_ATLAS", "ATLAS_GRID", "New Jersey", "NJDEP", "wells", "Atlas sheet", "well permit", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2018-09-27T18:04:15.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:07:03.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Bureau of Geographic Information Systems (BGIS)"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5891,38.9235,-73.8960,41.3589", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

Soils become naturally acidic for three major reasons: rainfall and leaching, acidic parent material, and decay of organic matter which produces hydrogen ions. Sulfide-bearing (pyritic) Cretaceous and Cenozoic marine and estuarine sediments, depicted on this map, are potential acid-soil producers. The development of acid-sulfate soils occurs when sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and/or elemental sulfur, in reduced sulfidic sediments, oxidize upon air exposure through drainage or earth-moving operations. The overall acid-sulfate soil-forming process involves a complex chain of reactions that connect the oxidation of iron sulfides to the release of iron oxyhydrates (+ hydronium jarosite, H3OFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6) and sulfuric acids. For pyrite and marcasite, the overall reaction is: FeS2 + 3.75O2 + 3.5 H2O -&gt; Fe(OH)3 + 2H2SO4 (pyrite/marcasite) (iron oxyhydrate) (sulfuric acid) Acid-sulfate soil formation occurs if the reduced sulfur components exceed the acid-neutralizing capacity of adsorbed bases and easily weatherable silicate and carbonate minerals. Natural Resource Conservation Service reports (see for example Soil Survey of Monmouth County) demonstrate that soils developed on these sulfidic, non-calcareous, marine sediments are strongly (pH &lt; 5.5) to extremely acid (pH &lt; 4.5). Depicted on the geologic map are the sedimentary units with the potential to produce acid (sulfate) soils: Kirkwood, Shark River, Manasquan, Hornerstown, Tinton, Sandy Hook Member of the Red Bank, Navesink, Wenonah, Marshalltown, Englishtown, Woodbury, Merchantville, Cheesequake, Magothy, and Raritan Formations.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["geology", "bedrock", "acid", "geoscientificInformation", "soils", "NJGWS", "New Jersey", "Geol_soil_acidsoil", "NJDEP", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2019-07-03T17:26:44.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:06:50.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey Geological Survey"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5745,39.4156,-73.9708,40.5746", "license": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

This map shows areas of historic fill covering more than approximately 5 acres. For the purposes of this map, historic fill is non-indigenous material placed on a site in order to raise the topographic elevation of the site. No representation is made as to the composition of the fill or presence of contamination in the fill. Some areas mapped as fill may contain chemical-production waste or ore-processing waste that exclude them from the legislative definition of historic fill. Fill was mapped from stereo aerial photography taken in March 1979, supplemented in places by planimetric aerial photography taken in the spring of 1991 and 1992. Additional areas of fill were mapped by comparing areas of swamp, marsh, and floodplain shown on archival topographic and geologic maps on file at the N. J. Geological Survey, dated between 1840 and 1910, to their modern extent. In a few places, fill was mapped from field observations and from drillers' logs of wells and borings. Most urban and suburban areas are underlain by a discontinuous layer of excavated indigenous soil mixed with varying amounts of non-indigenous material. This material generally does not meet the definition of historic fill and is not depicted on this map. Also, there may be historic fills that are not detectable on aerial photography or by archival map interpretation and so are not shown on this map, particularly along streams in urban and suburban areas. As of this January 2016 edition, twelve new quadrangles were added to the statewide coverage.

Alpha particles (symbol a) are a type of ionizing radiation ejected by the nuclei of some unstable atoms. These particles are essentially a helium nucleus having two protons and two neutrons. Most alpha emitters occur naturally in the environment. For example, the decay of naturally occurring uranium and thorium include many radioactive daughters that decay via alpha emission. Radionuclides are present in varying amounts in nearly all rocks, soils, and water. Human activity can also release radioactive substances into the environment.

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and algae, but is considered a pollutant when it stimulates excessive plant and algae growth. Overgrown vegetation and algae blooms in lakes can prevent recreational use for fishing and swimming. In severe cases, plant and algae die-off can deplete oxygen in the lake raising the potential for killing fish in the lake. Potential sources of phosphorus include discharges from sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows and stormwater runoff. As stormwater flows over the land, it may pick up phosphorus. Phosphorus contributions to stormwater runoff are calculated based on land uses within the lake's watershed.

Drought regions provide a regulatory basis for coordinating local responses to regional water-supply shortages. The six drought regions are based on watershed and water-supply considerations. Drought region boundaries coincide with municipal boundaries as referenced by the N.J. Dept of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Each municipality in New Jersey is assigned to a drought region based on the watershed covering and supplying water to the municipality. Each data record of the file includes name of the drought region. This is the second version of the drought regions. It differs from the original delineation in two ways: 1) The number of drought regions were expanded from five to six in order to account for water-supply issues identified for the New Jersey coastal plain. The original version included the north part of the Coastal Plain in the central region. Version 2 separates a north coastal region, consisting of Monmouth and northern Ocean Counties, from the coastal region to the south. 2) Municipalities in Mercer County receiving water from the Trenton Water Dept. were moved into the southwest region from the northwest. Pennington and Hopewell boroughs were also moved to the southwest region. This is the third version of the drought regions and was released in May 2004. There are two changes from the second version. Roosevelt Boro in Monmouth County was moved to the southwest drought region (from the coastal north) and Berlin Twp in Camden County was moved to the coastal south drought region (from the southwest). Both changes were made in recognition of the location of actual water supply to these municipalities.</span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["NJGS", "Envr_admin_drought_bnd", "State of", "NJDEP", "njdrought", "New Jersey", "drought", "water management", "none", "drought regions", "environment", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata"], "issued": "2018-12-19T17:08:58.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:47.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "NJDEP Bureau of GIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5873,38.9248,-73.8904,41.3576", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Distribution Agreement.

That is true despite the fact that much of its diverse landscape has been greatly altered by human enterprises such as agriculture and development that fragments and degrades wildlife habitat. Sustaining wildlife populations over time requires large healthy landscapes with broad expanses of natural habitat. Thus, the Landscape Project focuses on ecoregions or Landscape Regions where plant and animal communities are ecologically similar and closely interlinked. The delineation of the state into regions serves as a spatial framework for management and conservation of species and their habitats, and as a means to organize information so that it is meaningful and widely accessible to end-users. Geographic features and landforms (e.g., rivers, watershed boundaries, ridgelines, soils, vegetation, etc.) were used to delineate the general area of five Landscape Regions in New Jersey. Region boundaries were shifted to align with major roads (county level or larger) that serve as barriers to movement for many species. A sixth region, the Marine Region, is an exclusively aquatic region that includes the New Jersey portion of the Delaware and Raritan bays as well as the portion of the Atlantic Ocean along the coast of New Jersey. ENSP has identified and mapped habitat for endangered, threatened and special concern wildlife within each Landscape Region utilizing an extensive database that combines species occurrence information with land-use/land-cover classification data and species habitat requirements. The resulting Landscape maps provide an accurate, reliable and scientifically sound basis for habitat protection within each region. One of the Landscape Project\"s unique features is that it enables users to focus on the big picture, and not just on individual locations of imperiled and special concern species as those areas become threatened. Thus, within large landscapes, the Landscape Project identifies areas of endangered and threatened wildlife habitat that are important to the maintenance and recovery of New Jersey's endangered and threatened wildlife populations.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Natural Resources", "Conservation", "Ecology", "Water", "Marine", "Environment", "Ecosystem", "Exposure", "public", "biota", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Landscape", "NJDEP", "Envr_hab_ls_v3_3_regions"], "issued": "2018-11-26T19:42:56.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:38.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP)."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.6491,38.7918,-73.8818,41.3585", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.

Through an on-screen visual interpretation of digital orthophotography, CRSSA identified over 13,000 potential pools throughout the state. A subset of these pools was field verified and confirmed, with an 88% accuracy rate, to meet the physical characteristics to qualify as a vernal pool (Lathrop et al. 2005). In accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4, the term \"vernal habitat\" includes a vernal pool - or the area of ponding - plus any freshwater wetlands adjacent to the vernal pool. Vernal habitat areas mapped in the Landscape Project rely upon those data developed by the DEP and CRSSA to identify sites that should be field checked for possible identification as vernal habitats areas. DEP staff is in the process of field-verifying these pools. The Department also maps vernal habitat areas based upon on-the-ground assessment of sites not captured by the CRSSA mapping. The Landscape Project includes all of the CRSAA-identified sites, as well as sites identified by on-the-ground reconnaissance, categorized as either \"potential vernal habitat areas\" or \"vernal habitat areas\" as defined below: Potential vernal habitat area - These are areas identified by CRSSA as possibly containing a vernal pool that meets the criteria of a \"vernal habitat\" pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. These sites include sites that have been field inspected and have been found to meet the physical characteristics of a vernal habitat, but for which biological criteria have not yet been measured, as well as sites that have not been checked by DEP staff. Vernal habitat areas - These are areas that contain pools that have been field-verified by the Department and have been determined to meet both the physical and biological characteristics of a vernal habitat in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. All areas mapped as \"potential vernal habitat areas\" and \"vernal habitat areas\" are derived from a point location estimated to be the center of an individual vernal pool and include all areas within 300 meters of the point. Note that the occurrence area is not intended to suggest or correspond with any specific regulatory requirement. Rather, the area added around the point accounts for variations in the size of individual vernal pools, variations in the width of freshwater wetlands adjacent to the pool, plus adjacent habitats sufficient to include the estimated home range for vernal pool obligate species. If there is an overlap between areas mapped around two or more nearby points, the boundaries are conjoined to generate contiguous patches. If the resulting patch contains areas mapped as \"vernal habitat area\" and areas mapped as \"potential vernal habitat areas,\" the entire patch is labeled as a \"vernal habitat area.\"</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["biota", "Natural Resources", "Environment", "Marine", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "public", "Ecosystem", "Landscape", "New Jersey", "Ecology", "Water", "Exposure", "Conservation", "NJDEP", "Envr_hab_ls_v3_3_vernalhabitat"], "issued": "2018-11-26T16:02:50.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:15.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP)."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.5870,38.9312,-73.9007,41.3529", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.

In Version 3.3 of the Landscape Project, stream and water body centerlines from the NHD Streams 2002 data layer are used to represent freshwater mussel habitat.Water body centerline and stream centerline data are valued exclusively by freshwater mussel species occurrence areas while other aquatic species habitats are represented with polygons from the Species-Based Habitat layer. In order to form representative \"patches\" of habitat from the NHD Streams 2002 layer, centerlines were broken at the following points:The confluence of two or more streamsThe inflow/outflow of a water bodyStretches of stream intersected by a mussel SOA are valued as habitat. All valued streams are buffered by 0.75 kilometers upstream and downstream. The 0.75 kilometer distance is chosen as a conservative buffer estimate because scientific literature, which is based largely upon larval transport by host fishes, indicates that if there are two occurrences within two kilometers of each other (assuming unsuitable habitat between), these occurrences should be considered as part of the same local population (NatureServe 2011). In the cases where stream buffers of separate occurrences of the same species met, either upstream or downstream, the stream segments between those occurrences are also valued for that species. In addition, in cases where dams are barriers the extent of stream valued was limited.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>", "keyword": ["Natural Resources", "Conservation", "Ecology", "Water", "Marine", "Environment", "Ecosystem", "Exposure", "public", "biota", "New Jersey", "NJDEPTrentonMetadata", "Landscape", "NJDEP", "Envr_hab_ls_v3_3_streamhabitat"], "issued": "2018-11-26T15:29:50.000Z", "modified": "2021-11-08T16:04:11.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP)."}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NJDEPBGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gisnet@dep.nj.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-75.3717,39.3655,-74.2041,41.3771", "license": "<DIV STYLE=\"text-align:Left;\"><DIV><P><SPAN>This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.
