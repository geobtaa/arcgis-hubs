The Ethics Code also includes provisions to prevent conflicts of interests in voting and contracting. Perhaps most importantly, \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protection has been instituted so that employees who report suspected violations of the ethics code will not fear retribution.</span></font></p><p><font size='2'><span style='font-family: Arial;'>Key changes were also made to the Gift rule. The old $250 annual maximum allowance has been lowered to $25 per gift and an annual maximum of $100. Additionally, a broader scope of individuals are required to file an annual Economic Statements of Interest, and Economic Statements of Interest for all city and county elected officials are now required to be available online for public inspection. (See below).</span></font></p><p><font size='2'><span style='font-family: Arial;'>The ethics reform also requires that OCC train all new and existing appointees and employees on the new ethics code, the Open Door Law, and the Public Records Act.</span></font></p>", "keyword": ["Indianapolis", "Marion County", "Non-spatial", "Ethics", "DiscloseIndy"], "issued": "2016-04-21T18:28:11.000Z", "modified": "2019-01-16T16:07:38.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "City of Indianapolis and Marion County - IndyGIS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "IndyGIS", "hasEmail": "mailto:gis@indy.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "license": "<span style='overflow: auto;'><span><span style='overflow: auto;'><span><span style='overflow: auto;'><span><p><font size='2'><span style='font-family: Arial;'><b><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>NO WARRANTIES</span></b></span></font></p><font size='2'><span style='font-family: Arial;'>  </span></font><p><font size='2'><span style='font-family: Arial;'><span style='font-size: 12pt;'>All content on this website is provided to you as a public service to the citizens of the City of Indianapolis/Marion County, IN (\u201cCity/County\u201d) and to the internet community, and is intended to be used for reference only.
