Tax parcels are identified using township and section notation, in a modified format. The PLSS serves as a way for users to navigate the parcel geodatabase. This PLSS feature data set is intended to correspond to tax pages on the Cook County Tax Maps. They should not be used for measurement or surveyor purposes. In addition, the parcel attributes PINA (area/township) and PINSA (subarea/section) do not necessarily correspond to the PLSS township and section polygon in which a given parcel resides. The PLSS data is modeled as a single composite network coverage that encompasses townships (area), sections (subarea), quarter sections, and half quarter section. Tax map pages, which typically correspond to half quarter sections (in an east-west split), are modeled as a region subclass in the LANDFABRIC layer. If an indigenous people's reserve was present on the tax map, it was digitized to create subpolygons of the half-quarter section, and those polygons were attributed with the name of the reserve. Within this PLSS data set, a half-quarter section is the smallest polygon unit, except in cases where an Indigenous People's Reserve line is present. The cadastral data for Cook County have previously not been digital nor automated. This project is the initial automation for this information.

An additional 195 independent accuracy checkpoints, 116 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (116 NVA points), 79 in Tall Grass and Brushland/Low Trees categories (79 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.
