The data for the series of dashboards was gathered from the deliverables of SAW grants.

This is achieved through activities such as site evaluation, feasibility studies, operation and maintenance of systems, implementing land use and resource use restrictions, and monitoring. This data layer shows facilities that have been identified and mapped under Part 201, Environmental Remediation, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended (NREPA) those areas, places, or parcels of property, or portion of a parcel of property where a hazardous substance in excess of the concentrations that satisfy the cleanup criteria for unrestricted residential use has been released, deposited, disposed of, or otherwise comes to be located. This data layer does not include all of the facilities that are subject to regulation under Part 201 because owners are not required to inform EGLE about the facilities and can pursue cleanup independently. Facilities that are not known to EGLE are not on the Inventory, nor are locations with releases that resulted in low environmental impact. This data is regularly updated.</div><div><br /></div><div><div>\n\n<table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' style='border-collapse:collapse; border-style:solid; border-color:#A3A3A3; border-width:1pt;'>\n <tbody><tr>\n  <td style='border-style:solid;

The areas define a landscape in which management strategies are employed to protect public water supply wells from ground water contamination.<div><br /></div><div>This dataset is just community WHPAs, defined as Type I water supplies. It does not include WHPAs for Type II water supplies (noncommunity transient or non-transient supplies).<br /><div><br /><div><div>Wellhead Protection Areas in the dataset are categorized as traditional, provisional, and low vulnerability. The categories are used to describe how the wellhead protection area was identified.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>A traditional wellhead protection area is established by a hydrogeologic study. A hydrogeologic study includes an initial compiling of readily available information, the completion of fieldwork to obtain a better understanding of the hydrogeologic system, and groundwater modeling to identify the WHPA. Available information is normally sufficient to develop a rudimentary conceptualization of the hydrogeologic system and identify areas requiring additional acquisition of information and data. Fieldwork is completed to fill voids in the available information, confirm or modify the rudimentary conceptualization, and provide the information base necessary for groundwater flow modeling to delineate the WHPA. The available information and information collected through fieldwork is used to develop a final conceptualization of the hydrogeologic system. The final hydrogeologic conceptualization is incorporated into a groundwater flow model that is used to identify the WHPA.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are three widely accepted approaches for delineation of a WHPA. The three approaches reflect an increase in the amount of fieldwork, an increase in the level of complexity of the groundwater flow model, or both. The approaches will be referred to as follows: 1. Confirmation of Existing Information, 2. Direct Determination of Groundwater Flow Direction and Hydraulic Gradient, 3. Extensive Hydrogeologic Investigations. A common denominator to the three approaches is the use of &quot;reverse particle tracking&quot; to identify the WHPA. Particle tracking may be described as &quot;tracing the movement of an imaginary groundwater particle on the groundwater potentiometric surface.&quot; Thus, particle tracking identifies the path which groundwater takes in moving from areas of high energy to areas of low energy. In WHPA delineations it is more practical to perform the tracing of groundwater movement in reverse, or reverse particle tracking. Reverse particle tracking traces the movement of groundwater from areas of low energy to areas of high energy (i.e., from the pumping well back to the area of recharge). Reverse particle tracking eliminates the &quot;trial-and-error&quot; associated with forward particle tracking by eliminating areas of the potentiometric surface from which groundwater would not migrate to the well. With any of these three delineation approaches, there must be an appropriate aquifer test conducted for the water supply well. If there is not a test which meets the requirements of Aquifer Test Requirements for Public Water Supply Wells, an appropriate aquifer test will need to be performed.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>A provisional wellhead protection area is an area which has been approved by the department in accordance with the State of Michigan wellhead protection program as the wellhead protection area based on computer manipulation of existing state of Michigan databases.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>A low vulnerability wellhead protection area is one that is defined by having low tritium concentrations indicating the source water pre-dates nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>The traditional WHPAs and any updates are typically submitted by consultants who work for community water supplies. The WHPAs and updates are added to the system through GIS georeferencing and digitization as they are submitted and approved by the Department. The provisional wellhead delineations were completed by EGLE staff using MGMT groundwater modeling software program. The provisional WHPAs were created prior to 2013.\u00a0</div></div><div><br /></div><div><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' style='border-collapse:collapse; border:none;'>\n <tbody><tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p><b>Field Name</b></p>\n  </td>\n  <td style='width:233.75pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>\n  <p><b>Description</b></p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-top:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p>AREA</p>\n  </td>\n  <td style='width:233.75pt; border-top:none; border-left:none; border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>\n  <p>Area of the WHPA in square miles</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-top:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p>WSSN</p>\n  </td>\n  <td style='width:233.75pt; border-top:none; border-left:none; border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>\n  <p>Water Supply Serial Number</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-top:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p>SYSTEM</p></td><td style='width:233.75pt; border-top:none; border-left:none; border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>Water Supply System Name</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-top:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p>TYPE</p>\n  </td>\n  <td style='width:233.75pt; border-top:none; border-left:none; border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>\n  <p>Provisional or Traditional WHPA</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td style='width:93.85pt; border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-top:none; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='125'>\n  <p>APPROVAL_DATE</p>\n  </td>\n  <td style='width:233.75pt; border-top:none; border-left:none; border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;' valign='top' width='312'>\n  <p>Date WHPA approved by EGLE</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</tbody></table></div><div><br /></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["Michigan", "EGLE", "MI", "Wellhead", "WHPA", "Provisional", "Traditional", "Low Vulnerability", "Public Water Supply", "DWEHD", "Drinking Water", "Drinking Water and Environmental Health Division", "Environmental Health", "Environment", "Source Water Protection", "Wells", "Well", "Groundwater", "Boundary", "Boundaries"], "issued": "2022-07-07T17:05:41.000Z", "modified": "2022-10-06T21:24:59.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "EgleAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:egle-maps@michigan.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-90.2297,41.9061,-82.5252,47.6589", "license": "<p style='text-align:justify; margin:0in;'><font size='2'>This dataset is a public record and, as more fully described below, there are no restrictions on the use, reproduction, or distribution of this dataset.

According to R 281.22 (22) the department shall update the recession rate studies every 10 years to reflect varying lake levels and changes in erosion rates. Of 29 counties currently designated 12 counties have not been updated since designation. Counties in the Lower Peninsula on Lake Michigan were last updated in the mid-1990s except for Berrien which was updated in 2007.  Updates continue and the dataset is updated periodically to represent these changes. To determine these zones extensive work goes into identifying erosion hazard lines, and tools are run to determine erosion rates.  The zones are then created as polygons to represent the erosion zones.

NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the two inland stream trout and salmon regulation GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the RegulationType field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). The RegulationType and Designated field are concatenated in the RegTypeDes to show the full type regulation and designation status. In some cases, a stream will have more than one regulation type assigned. In which case, the RegulationType field will have both types listed, as will the RegTypeDes field. Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: Type 1 \u2013 Type 1 Trout Stream; Type 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; Type 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; Type 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; BTRA \u2013 Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, there are some polygon features that cannot be displayed in this line layer and are represented in the BTRA polygon layer. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, both layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the main stream regulations layer. When displaying the inland trout and salmon streams with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F &amp;amp; Special Type, both of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F &amp;amp; Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by opening the feature class properties in the Table of Contents in ArcMap, then go to Symbology, then Advanced, then Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: Type 4 Non Designated, Type 3 Non Designated, GR Type 4 Designated, GR Type 2 Designated, GR Type 1 Designated, GR Designated, RA Designated, Type 4 Designated, Type 4 BTRA Designated, Type 3 Designated, Type 3 BRTA Designated, Type 2 Designated, Type 1 Designated, and Type 1 BTRA Designated.

In cases where the same intervals were samples on more than one occasion during a given year, the highest 1,4-dioxane values were used. The extent of each annual model were limited to polygons based on only the wells that were sampled during the associated year to eliminate interpolating in areas where data is not present. The annual geochemical models were then filtered based on lithology to eliminate any voxels within the areas deemed impermeable based on lithology. The models were further constrained by utilizing the maximum historical water level surface (MHWLS) grid model to further restrict the interpolation from areas lacking measured data. Finally, the voxel models were converted to annual grid models, in which the cell values are based on the highest value within the corresponding column of voxels.<br /></p><p>The 2020 plume presented here was created from the RockWorks project database files on June 09, 2021 (Gelman3.sqlite v2021-04-29). The grid file titled\u00a02020-01-01_to_2020-12-31.RwGrd (v20210710)\u00a0was converted by The Mannik and Smith Group (MSG) to a raster file compatible in ArcGIS and a custom color scheme was applied with the shades becoming darker as concentrations increase. Iso-concentration lines were then generated at the following concentrations: 4 ppb, 7.2 ppb, 85 ppb, 150 ppb, 280 ppb, 500 ppb, 1000 ppb, 1900 ppb, 3000 ppb, and 5000 ppb. The 7.2 ppb lines were created because it represents the current EGLE Part 201 generic residential cleanup criterion (GRCC). The 85 ppb lines were created to represent the Consent Judgement 3 (CJ3) drinking water criteria. The 280 ppb lines were created because that is the new EGLE groundwater-surface water interface (GSI) criterion, and 1900 ppb is the Vapor Intrusion criteria. EGLE is contouring the 4 ppb level because that could become a new trigger for response if detected in sentinel wells if the proposed 4th Consent Judgment is approved.</p><p>To host the plume files on EGLE's ArcGIS Online, MSG prepared the raster file, contour layer, and the input points used as the input for the specified year model in ArcGIS Pro. The points were labeled using three levels of detail. When zoomed out beyond 1:5000 no labels appear at the points because it would be too dense to read and cover the underlying plume. When zoomed in between 1:5000 and 1:1200, the bore name and maximum 1,4-dioxane at that well in 2020 appear. When zoomed in closer than 1:1200, the labels show the boring name, sample depth interval, and maximum 1,4-dioxane at that interval for 2020.\u00a0The plume layer was set to 7.5% transparency (this can be adjusted later) and shared as a web tile layer using the ArcGIS Online / Bing Maps / Google Maps tiling scheme for levels of detail 12 \u2013 19.</p><p>This data is used in the\u00a0<a href='https://egle.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b2d077fdef2b4005883a5305a92ad1df' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Gelman Site of 1,4-Dioxane Contamination web map</a>\u00a0(<a href='https://egle.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b2d077fdef2b4005883a5305a92ad1df' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>item details</a>).\u00a0If you have questions regarding the Gelman Sciences, Inc site of contamination contact Dan Hamel at 517-745-6595 or\u00a0<a href='mailto:hameld@michigan.gov' style='box-sizing:border-box;' rel='nofollow ugc'>HamelD@michigan.gov</a>.\u00a0<span style='box-sizing:border-box;'>Report problems or data functionality suggestions to\u00a0</span><a href='mailto:EGLE-Maps@Michigan.gov' style='box-sizing:border-box;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>EGLE-Maps@Michigan.gov</a><span style='box-sizing:border-box;'>.\u00a0</span></p><div><p><span></span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["Michigan", "EGLE", "Remediation and Redevelopment Division", "Remediation", "1-4 dioxane", "Gelman"], "issued": "2021-07-16T20:11:51.000Z", "modified": "2021-12-09T15:13:24.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "EgleAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:egle-maps@michigan.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-83.8381,42.2674,-83.7321,42.2995", "license": "<div style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:small;'>This dataset is a public record and, as more fully described below, there are no restrictions on the use, reproduction, or distribution of this dataset.

NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200 and FO 210. Except for streams in the Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters, any other inland stream not classified by type (1-4; GR, RA, BTRA) are still subject to trout and salmon fishing regulations as described on page 40 of the Michigan Fishing Guide. Please see pp. 24-25 for Michigan-Wisconsin Boundary Waters regulations. Note that the two inland stream trout and salmon regulation GIS layers only show the streams classified by type; these layers do not include any streams that are not classified by type. The regulation type associated with a stream feature is indicated in the RegulationType field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated). The RegulationType and Designated field are concatenated in the RegTypeDes to show the full type regulation and designation status. In some cases, a stream will have more than one regulation type assigned. In which case, the RegulationType field will have both types listed, as will the RegTypeDes field. Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types. Regulation types are as follows: Type 1 \u2013 Type 1 Trout Stream; Type 2 - Type 2 Trout Stream; Type 3 - Type 3 Trout Stream; Type 4 - Type 4 Trout Stream; BTRA \u2013 Brook Trout Restoration Area; RA - Research Area Trout Stream; GR - Gear Restricted Stream. Designation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, RA, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. The main layer shows the majority of inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations. However, there are some polygon features that cannot be displayed in this line layer and are therefore represented in the BTRA polygon layer. To show all inland streams that are classified by type for trout and salmon regulations, both layers must be displayed in the proper order using established symbology. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the main stream regulations layer. When displaying the inland trout and salmon streams with inland trout and salmon lakes Types A-F &amp;amp; Special Type, both of the stream layers should be displayed underneath the Types A-F &amp;amp; Special Type layer. For the main regulation type layer, set the drawing order so that specific regulations type display on top of others. Do this by opening the feature class properties in the Table of Contents in ArcMap, then go to Symbology, then Advanced, then Symbol levels and using the following order, from top to bottom: Type 4 Non Designated, Type 3 Non Designated, GR Type 4 Designated, GR Type 2 Designated, GR Type 1 Designated, GR Designated, RA Designated, Type 4 Designated, Type 4 BTRA Designated, Type 3 Designated, Type 3 BRTA Designated, Type 2 Designated, Type 1 Designated, and Type 1 BTRA Designated.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Fisheries Division created this GIS layer in 2019 to depict the MDNR Michigan Great Lakes grid (v3.2) standard for Fisheries Division applications for the waters of the State of Michigan, and for Canadian waters in the St. Clair Detroit River System (SCDRS), as of June 2019. This GIS layer was created by incorporating grid boundaries and ID values from a number of existing grid standards.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>This layer is a composite grid that incorporates grid boundaries and ID values from the following GIS data standards for different areas of the Great Lakes: 1) 10-minute grids for Lakes Huron, Michigan, Superior and the St. Mary\u2019s River came from the Institute for Fisheries Research (IFR) version 1 (v1) of the 10-minute grids. 2) 10-minute grids for Lake Erie came from version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids created by the Great Lakes GIS (GLGIS) project, and 3) 5-minute grids for SCDRS came from 5-minute grids developed by the GLGIS project.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Version 1 of the IFR 10-minute grids were created in 1998, and only covered Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, and the St. Mary\u2019s River. This is the GIS dataset that was used as the grid standard for the 2000 consent decree. The grid boundaries and ID values in v1 were based off of the paper maps depicted in the 1989 Status of the Fisheries Resource Report (Technical Review Committee, 1989) with some very minor grid boundary differences likely caused by bringing the paper map into a digital GIS format. In v1, 10-minute grids do not always have rectangular boundaries where each side represents 10-minutes of latitude and longitude, especially near the shoreline. In order to create the v3.2 composite layer, some features in the v1 GIS dataset that were missing ID values were assigned ID values based on historical creel maps or nearby grid ID values.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids was created in 2006 and provides coverage forall five Great Lakes, but only partial coverage in the connecting channels, with no coverage in SCDRS. In contrast to v1, 10-minute grids in this dataset are true 10-minute grids with rectangular sides that strictly follow 10-minute latitude and longitude lines (along with some cases where two true 10-minute grids were combined into one grid cell with one ID value). Due to the differences in grid boundaries, there are some different ID values across v1 and v2.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>The GLGIS 5-minute grid GIS dataset was created in 2006 at IFR. This layer contains rectangular 5-minute grids that are true 5-minute grids, with each side of every grid representing 5-minutes of latitude or longitude. 5-minute grids were used for SCDRS in v3.2 to align with historical data reporting standards in the region, and because there are no 10-minute grids that fully cover SCDRS. 5-minute grids created by the GLGIS only exist for SCDRS, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron, and the reason for this is unknown.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>SCDRS grids on the Canadian side of the basin are included in v3.2 for Fisheries Division data reporting needs that may include Canadian areas of SCDRS, but these grids in Canadian waters may not represent the standard that is actively used by Canadian agencies.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>In order to create the v3.2 composite, grid cells from the various GIS data sources were merged together for water bodies as specified above. In v3.2 the grids are almost exactly as they appear in the source data (with minor edits such as edge matching) except where 10-minute grids 602 and 603 in Lake Erie from Version 2 were replaced with GLGIS 5-minute grids. These grids cover the transition between the Detroit River and Lake Erie, where 10-minute grids are too large for some fisheries data reporting purposes. Therefore in v3.2, the two 10-minute grids were replaced with four 5-minute grids from the GLGIS 5-minute grid dataset. ID values were kept from the 5-minute grids for the two northern cells but the two southern grids cells retain ID values from the GLGIS v2 10-minute grids (602 and 603). This was done to allow continuity with historical data that has been recorded for 10-minute grids 602 and 603, but users need to be aware that these ID values in v3.2 are now associated with 5-minute grids instead of 10-minute grids.\u00a0</div><div>Version 3.2 was subsequently slightly altered to create Version 3.3, which replaced the shoreline in Northern Lake Huron and slightly altered the shoreline near the Soo Locks in the St. Mary's River to match zones, closures, etc. described in the Consent Decree that were depicted with a more detailed shoreline than the v3.2 shoreline. This was done so that those zones, closures, etc. could be depicted along with the Michigan Great Lakes Grids and have alligning shoerline depictions (see Figures 13, 12 &amp; 16 for examples of the more detailed shoreline).\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>GIS layer was last updated 10/01/2019.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Metadata last updated 10/02/2019.\u00a0</div>", "keyword": ["Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR)", "Great Lakes", "Grids", "Institute for Fisheries Research (IFR)", "5-minute", "10-minute"], "issued": "2019-07-10T14:15:48.000Z", "modified": "2022-09-08T13:10:54.813Z", "publisher": {"name": "Michigan Department of Natural Resources"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "MichiganDNR", "hasEmail": "mailto:DNR-GIS@michigan.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-168.2359,69.8489,170.7831,76.1023", "license": "<p style='margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri;'><font size='3'>Note that organizations may be using slightly different versions of grid datasets across the basin, so exercise caution when exchanging grid data summaries.

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream-flow gauging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gauging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.", "keyword": ["Michigan", "Hydrology", "EGLE", "Groundwater", "Lakes and Streams"], "issued": "2020-07-31T12:03:48.000Z", "modified": "2022-08-17T16:27:08.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "EgleAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:egle-maps@michigan.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-167.0934,69.4683,173.9906,76.1809", "license": "<p style='text-align:justify;'><font size='2'>This dataset is a public record and, as more fully described below, there are no restrictions on the use, reproduction, or distribution of this dataset.

Michigan has derived Part 4 Rule 57 water quality values for two\nPFAS: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The\nHuman Noncancer Value (HNV) for PFOS is 11 parts per trillion (ppt) for surface\nwaters used as a drinking water source and 12 ppt for all other water bodies.\nThe PFOA HNV is 420 ppt for surface waters used as a drinking water source and\n12,000 ppt for all other water bodies.</p><p>Contaminant data often include flags, also known as qualifiers,\nwhich are notes attached to data that gives detailed information about that\nparticular result. In the surface water PFAS data layer, PFAS analytes\nassociated with a \u201cK\u201d flag were not detected in the sample and therefore the\nmethod detection limit (MDL) is displayed. \u201cJ\u201d flagged results indicates an\nestimated concentration as the result is above the MDL but below the laboratory\nreporting limit.<br /></p><p>The number of PFAS analytes EGLE analyzes in surface water samples\nhas increased over the years. EGLE is currently analyzing for 29 PFAS analytes\nin surface water samples.

The extent of each annual model were limited to polygons based on only the wells that were sampled during the associated year to eliminate interpolating in areas where data is not present. The annual geochemical models were then filtered based on lithology to eliminate any voxels within the areas deemed impermeable based on lithology. The models were further constrained by utilizing the maximum historical water level surface (MHWLS) grid model to further restrict the interpolation from areas lacking measured data. Finally, the voxel models were converted to annual grid models, in which the cell values are based on the highest value within the corresponding column of voxels.<br /></p><p>The 2020 plume presented here was created from the RockWorks project database files on June 09, 2021 (Gelman3.sqlite v2021-04-29).

The 7.2 ppb lines were created because it represents the current EGLE Part 201 generic residential cleanup criterion (GRCC). The 85 ppb lines were created to represent the Consent Judgement 3 (CJ3) drinking water criteria. The 280 ppb lines were created because that is the new EGLE groundwater-surface water interface (GSI) criterion, and 1900 ppb is the Vapor Intrusion criteria.

In cases where the same intervals were samples on more than one occasion during a given year, the highest 1,4-dioxane values were used. The extent of each annual model were limited to polygons based on only the wells that were sampled during the associated year to eliminate interpolating in areas where data is not present. The annual geochemical models were then filtered based on lithology to eliminate any voxels within the areas deemed impermeable based on lithology. The models were further constrained by utilizing the maximum historical water level surface (MHWLS) grid model to further restrict the interpolation from areas lacking measured data. Finally, the voxel models were converted to annual grid models, in which the cell values are based on the highest value within the corresponding column of voxels.<br /></p><p>The 2020 plume presented here was created from the RockWorks project database files on June 09, 2021 (Gelman3.sqlite v2021-04-29). The grid file titled\u00a02020-01-01_to_2020-12-31.RwGrd (v20210710)\u00a0was converted by The Mannik and Smith Group (MSG) to a raster file compatible in ArcGIS and a custom color scheme was applied with the shades becoming darker as concentrations increase. Iso-concentration lines were then generated at the following concentrations: 4 ppb, 7.2 ppb, 85 ppb, 150 ppb, 280 ppb, 500 ppb, 1000 ppb, 1900 ppb, 3000 ppb, and 5000 ppb. The 7.2 ppb lines were created because it represents the current EGLE Part 201 generic residential cleanup criterion (GRCC). The 85 ppb lines were created to represent the Consent Judgement 3 (CJ3) drinking water criteria. The 280 ppb lines were created because that is the new EGLE groundwater-surface water interface (GSI) criterion, and 1900 ppb is the Vapor Intrusion criteria. EGLE is contouring the 4 ppb level because that could become a new trigger for response if detected in sentinel wells if the proposed 4th Consent Judgment is approved.</p><p>To host the plume files on EGLE's ArcGIS Online, MSG prepared the raster file, contour layer, and the input points used as the input for the specified year model in ArcGIS Pro. The points were labeled using three levels of detail. When zoomed out beyond 1:5000 no labels appear at the points because it would be too dense to read and cover the underlying plume. When zoomed in between 1:5000 and 1:1200, the bore name and maximum 1,4-dioxane at that well in 2020 appear. When zoomed in closer than 1:1200, the labels show the boring name, sample depth interval, and maximum 1,4-dioxane at that interval for 2020.\u00a0The plume layer was set to 7.5% transparency (this can be adjusted later) and shared as a web tile layer using the ArcGIS Online / Bing Maps / Google Maps tiling scheme for levels of detail 12 \u2013 19.</p><p>This data is used in the\u00a0<a href='https://egle.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b2d077fdef2b4005883a5305a92ad1df' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Gelman Site of 1,4-Dioxane Contamination web map</a>\u00a0(<a href='https://egle.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b2d077fdef2b4005883a5305a92ad1df' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>item details</a>).\u00a0If you have questions regarding the Gelman Sciences, Inc site of contamination contact Dan Hamel at 517-745-6595 or\u00a0<a href='mailto:hameld@michigan.gov' style='box-sizing:border-box;' rel='nofollow ugc'>HamelD@michigan.gov</a>.\u00a0<span style='box-sizing:border-box;'>Report problems or data functionality suggestions to\u00a0</span><a href='mailto:EGLE-Maps@Michigan.gov' style='box-sizing:border-box;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>EGLE-Maps@Michigan.gov</a><span style='box-sizing:border-box;'>.\u00a0</span></p><div><p><span></span></p></div></div>", "keyword": ["Michigan", "EGLE", "Remediation and Redevelopment Division", "Remediation", "1-4 dioxane", "Gelman"], "issued": "2021-07-16T20:11:51.000Z", "modified": "2021-12-09T15:13:24.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "EgleAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:egle-maps@michigan.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-128.4064,31.9895,-83.7443,42.3047", "license": "<div style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:small;'>This dataset is a public record and, as more fully described below, there are no restrictions on the use, reproduction, or distribution of this dataset.
