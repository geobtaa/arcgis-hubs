Users should furthermore recognize that a given species may sometimes occur outside of its range.

There are two main ecoregion maps for the United States, one developed by the U.S. Forest Service (Bailey et al. 1994) and the other developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Omernik et al. 1987). For the Natural Legacy Project we delineated ecoregions using primarily Level III ecoregion lines from Ecoregions of Nebraska and Kansas (Chapman et al. 2001), which was a joint project of the USFS and EPA to blend the two systems. However, we used Bailey's Section level line to delineate the western boundary of tallgrass prairie south of the Sandhills since this was a better fit with Kaul and Rolfsmeier's (1993) map of the native vegetation of Nebraska.</span></p></div></div></div>", "keyword": ["ecoregions", "ecology", "plant communities"], "issued": "2021-10-14T14:42:55.000Z", "modified": "2021-10-14T14:45:37.501Z", "publisher": {"name": "Nebraska Game & Parks Commission"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "NGPC.GISAdmin", "hasEmail": "mailto:ngpc.gis@nebraska.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "spatial": "-103.9706,39.8915,-95.1307,43.0468", "license": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>These data are a very rough approximation of reality and are designed for visualization rather than analysis.

The 303(d) Listed Impaired Waters program system provides impaired water data and impaired water features reflecting river segments, lakes, and estuaries designated under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Each State will establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these waters. Note the CWA Section 303(d) list of impaired waters does not represent waters that are impaired but have an EPA-approved TMDL established, impaired waters for which other pollution control mechanisms are in place and expected to attain water quality standards, or waters impaired as a result of pollution and is not caused by a pollutant. Therefore, the &quot;Impaired Waters&quot; layers do not represent all impaired waters reported in a state's Integrated Report, but only the waters comprised of a state's approved 303(d) list. For more information regarding impaired waters refer to EPA's Integrated Reporting Guidance at: http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/tmdl/guidance.cfm. 303(d) waterbodies are coded onto NHDPlus v2.1 flowline and waterbody features to create line, area, and point events. In addition to NHDPlus reach indexed data there may also be custom event data (point, line, or polygon) that are not associated with NHDPlus and are in an EPA standard format that is compatible with EPA's Reach Address Database.
