This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe's Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite's paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1).

Chicago Historic Resources Survey - Red and Orange Buildings - KML [Illinois--Chicago],Chicago Historic Resources Survey - Red and Orange Buildings - KML,"The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940. During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance. Please note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey: 1.	A color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance. This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: ""Red"" and ""Orange."" Buildings and structures coded ""Red"" or ""Orange"" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago's Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003. 2.	Only buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented. Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded. If an ""Orange""- or ""Red""-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map. The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as ""Orange"" or ""Red;"" however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as ""Orange"" or ""Red."" Additional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.

Liquor Moratorium Districts - Packaged Goods [Illinois--Chicago],Liquor Moratorium Districts - Packaged Goods,"There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: 	CODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. 	ST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. 	CREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. To view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

Chicago Historic Resources Survey - Red and Orange Buildings [Illinois--Chicago],Chicago Historic Resources Survey - Red and Orange Buildings,"The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940. During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance. Please note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey: 1.	A color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance. This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: ""Red"" and ""Orange."" Buildings and structures coded ""Red"" or ""Orange"" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago's Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003. 2.	Only buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented. Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded. If an ""Orange""- or ""Red""-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map. The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as ""Orange"" or ""Red;"" however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as ""Orange"" or ""Red."" Additional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.
